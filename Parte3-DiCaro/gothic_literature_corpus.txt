GOTHIC LITERATURE
2.1

Gothicism : Meaning, Origin and Scope:
What is Gothic? This question cannot be answered in a sentence. It is

an art, lifestyle and a certain sensibility. The word ‘gothic’ can be defined in
three ways. Firstly ‘a building such as a cathedral that has a style of
architecture that is distinguished by all pillars, high vaulted ceiling and
pointed arches.’ Secondly ‘Gothic’ is used to describe stories in which
strange, mysterious and adventurous happen in dark and lonely places such
as the ruins of a castle.’ Lastly the Gothic is ‘a style of printing or writing in
which the letters are very ornate.’
The word Gothic is an architectural term. The style is best known
for the pointed arch that was the feature of Gothic churches. Gothic
architecture was prevalent in Western Europe between the 12th and 16th
centuries
Gothic literature has little to do with Gothic architecture. The word
Gothic literature refers to a mode of fiction dealing with supernatural or
horrifying events. However Gothic literature is concerned with the
supernatural and not all Gothic literature is horrifying. Rather the term
Gothic as applied to literature refers to a kind of atmosphere or aesthetics
that while it is hard to define, may be understood at an instinctive level, in a
way similar to that in which Japanese terms such as ‘wabi’ and ‘sabi” are
difficult to define, but are immediately evocative to someone with cultural
background.
36

The Gothic is termed in the dictionary with crudity. This definition
coincides with gothic literature. Gothic literature explores the aggression
between what we fear and what we lust. The setting of these Gothic stories
were usually in some kind of castle or old building that showed human
decay and created an atmosphere of mystery and suspense. Supernatural and
unexplainable events are crucial to the plot of a Gothic story. Often they act
as the backbone of plot and many of the circumstances and coincidences rest
upon them. After reading John Goldsworthy’s Piece and Bram Stokers
Dracula, it is known that the setting the idea in a supernatural and
explainable way is crucial.
The Gothic literature dealing with demons and abnormal states of mind
is not a phenomenon of only medievalism and romanticism, modernism and
perversion, death and destruction resulting from political and social
aberrations; the fantasy is also a part of the Gothic. According to
contemporary American writer Joyce Carole Oates, who is clubbed together
with Edgar Allan Poe as a Gothic writer, “Gothicism, whatever it is, is not a
literary tradition so much as a fairly realistic assessment of modern life.”1
One of the key points in Gothicism is the idea that something is either
extremely grotesque to the point of being ugly or that the idea so widely
unaccepted that it is proclaimed as a sin against either humanity or the
church. This statement separates man and God and indicates the fallen state
of man. The dark Gothic style surrounds death. Sometimes, the Gothic is
anti-human or anti-social.
The word ‘Goth’ and ‘Gothic’ described the Germanic tribes (eg.
Goths, Visigoths or Ostrogoths) who sacked Rome and ravaged the rest of
Europe in 3rd , 4th and 5th centuries. From this source, the word Gothic came
37

to mean barbarous. By the 18th century in England, the Gothic had become
synonymous with the Middle Ages, a period which was in disfavor because
it was perceived as unenlightened and chaotic. The word Gothic first
recorded in 1611 in a reference to the language of the Goths was extended in
sense in several ways, meaning Germanic, medieval, barbarous and also an
architectural style that was not Greek or Roman. Horace Walpole applied the
word Gothic in his novel The Castle of Otranto: a Gothic Story (1765).
From this novel filled with scenes of terror and gloom in a medieval setting
descended a literary genre still popular today. The title of the novel gives us
a clue to some of the essential elements of Gothic literature. The key word is
‘castle.’ Those ancient buildings may be viewed as symbolic of the unique
atmosphere of Gothic literature; the writing style of gothic novel is as heavy
as castle masonry and as gloomy as the maze-like corridors of such a
medieval building.
However, Gothic literature was said to be born in 1764. It originated in
the 18th century, flourished in the 19th century and continues to thrive even
today. In literature especially in Gothicism the setting is greatly influential.
It not only evokes the atmosphere of horror and dread, but also portrays the
deterioration of its world. The decaying, ruined scenery implies that at one
time the abbey, castle, or landscape was something treasured and
appreciated. Now all that lasts is the decaying shell of a once thriving
dwelling. The Gothic hero becomes a sort of archetype as we find that there
is a pattern to their characterization. There is always the protagonist, usually
isolated either voluntarily or involuntarily. Then there is the villain who is
the epitome of evil, either by his own fall from grace or by some implicit
malevolence. Setting in a castle the action takes place in and around an old
38

castle, sometimes seemingly abandoned, sometimes occupied. The castle
often contains secret passages, trapdoors, secret rooms, dark or hidden
staircases, and possibly ruined sections. The castle may be near or connected
to caves, which lend their own haunting flavor with their branching,
claustrophobia and mystery.
An atmosphere of mystery and suspense is one of the Gothic
elements. The work is pervaded by a threatening feeling, a fear enhanced by
the unknown. Often the plot itself is built around a mystery, such as
unknown parentage, a disappearance or some other inexplicable element. An
ancient prophecy is connected with the castle or its inhabitants. The
prophecy is usually obscure, partial or confusing. “What could it mean?” in
modern examples, this may amount to merely a legend. Omens, portents,
visions are Gothic elements. A character may have a disturbing dream vision
or some phenomenon maybe seen as a portent of coming events. For
example, if the statue of the lord of the manor fails over, it may portend his
death. In modern fiction a character might see something and think that it
was a dream. This might be thought of as an imitation vision.
Supernatural or otherwise inexplicable events are the Gothic elements
of literature. Dramatic, amazing events occur, such as ghosts or giants
walking or inanimate objects coming to life. In some works the events are
ultimately given a natural explanation, while in others, the events are truly
supernatural. High, even overwrought emotion that is the narration may be
highly sentimental and the characters are often overcome by anger, sorrow,
surprise and especially terror. Characters suffer from raw nerves and a
feeling of impending doom. Crying and emotional speeches are frequent.
Bloodletting and blood drinking differ from the act of cutting oneself. The
39

motivations might be the same, but the desired ends can be different. Blood
drinking can be solitary between two people or in a group whereas cutting
oneself is almost always solitary. The main difference between the two is
that the focus is more on the blood than the pain with drinking. Blood has
historically been powerful symbol in literature signifying both life and death.
The vampire imitation symbolizes the blood letting. Vampires were once
represented as demons and creatures of the devil in folklore. They were
surrounded by superstitions concerning garlic, holy water and crosses. The
vampire is no longer the murderous demon, but a symbol of what humanity
wishes it could be fearless, immortal, indulgent and powerful. Teenagers
especially tend to find the vampiric symbol attractive when they feel very
powerless, restricted, uncertain and anxious. This category consists of
people who find pleasure in imitating the vampire lifestyle. Some take it
fairly seriously indeed. They do not kill to get blood, but they will drink
from themselves or any willing donors using controlled cutting techniques.
Curiosity and experimentation represents blood letting. It makes people to
see what it tastes like, how it feels, how blood flows, what it looks like. The
killers, religious cults, fanatics are some people that are extremists who
practice blood-letting and blood drinking for entirely different motivations
than all of the aforementioned categories. These groups might kill a human
or animal to get blood. They might drink it out of a glass. They may offer
bloodshed as a religious offering and sacrifice. They may drink or let blood
as part of a ceremonial ritual. These extremists often believe that blood is a
powerful agent that it can help gain immortality. They use it to worship
deity. Blood letting or drinking may rarely also be a motivation for murder.

40

Depression and sadness is an abnormality that must be suppressed or
cured. Adolescence is a time of depression for many individuals. Yet those
individuals may feel pressure from family, friends or teachers to be perfect.
These young people may feel incredible pain, but do now show it for fear of
being derided as if they are abnormal. Depression is one emotion that
typifies Goth best. Gothic is an exaggerated personification. While Goths are
capable of feeling extreme sadness, they are also capable of experiencing
great joy. Most are able to maintain balance in their lives. Women are
threatened by a powerful, impulsive, tyrannical male. One or more male
characters have the power, as king, lord of the manor, father or guardian to
demand that one or more of the female characters do something intolerable.
The woman may be commanded to marry someone she does not love or
commit a crime. The metonymy of gloom and horror are the Gothic
elements of literature. Metonymy is a subtype of metaphor, in which
something is used to stand for something else like sorrow. Some
metonymies for “doom and gloom” all suggest some element of mystery,
danger or the supernatural. For example, howling wind, blowing rain, doors
grating on rusty hinges, eerie sounds, footsteps approaching, clanking
chains, lights in abandoned rooms, gusts of winds blowing out lights, doors
suddenly slamming shut, characters trapped in a room, ruins of buildings and
crazed laughter.
Death fixation is one of the most stereotypes. Surrounding Goth is the
subculture’s fixation on death. Much of the symbolism and the look seem to
connote as the very least an interest in the topic. The depth of this interest
would vary with each individual, as always. In general, Goths are an
exaggeration of the darker side of the human psyche. They represent
41

outwardly the thought that linger in the back of everyone’s mind. Goths tend
to make their feelings about a little more open than the rest of the world.
Death in literature, in life and in religion has always been a monumental
driving force in many of humanities. All of humanity is fixed on death in a
more subtle way. Gothic represents acceptance of the inevitability of death
and the existence of the darker sides of life.
2.2

The History of Gothic Literature:
Most of the settings chosen in Gothic tales tended to be in the eastern

half of Europe, because the eastern part of Europe was unknown to most of
the people living in Western Europe. This is a matter of remoteness due to
the fact that the people had little information about Eastern Europe or the
fear of the unknown. The Western Europe was civilized.
The word Gothic existed long before it became a genre term. In
origin, it is a race term. The Gothic tribes had homelands in Germany and
the Scandinavia. The Goths invaded central and southern Europe and made
attacks on Rome and Greece, the seats of civilization. Indeed, the ‘Goth’ and
‘Gothic’ have become synonymous with barbarism. Italians blamed the
Goths for destroying Roman Empire; and they called their art style of this
period ‘Gothic’ by which they meant barbaric. Of course, this was a black
and white view and during the Middle Ages much beautiful art was made.
Indeed, this is a part from European Renaissance today.
Gothic as an ethnic and a cultural concept, of course, originates in
Europe and the manuals of European history tell us that Gothic settlement
developed from the east to the south and west.

42

Literary works in the sixteenth century England were rarely if ever
created in isolation from other currents in the social and cultural world. We
have no way of knowing to what extent, if at all this dream of literary power
was ever realized in the world. Many sixteenth century writers such as
Christopher Marlowe, Edmund Spenser and William Shakespeare, brooded
on the magical transforming power of art. This power could be associated
with civility and virtue, as Sidney claims but it could also have the demonic
qualities manifested by the pleasing words of Spenser’s enchanter
Archimago or by the incantations of Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus. It is
significant that Marlowe’s great play was written at a time in which the
possibility of sorcery was not merely a theatrical fantasy but a widely shared
fear, a fear upon which the state could act-as the case Doctor Faustus vividly
shows with horrendous ferocity.
The earlier seventeenth century and especially the period of the
English Revolution (1640-60) was a time, an intense ferment in all areas of
life, religion, science, politics, domestic relations, culture.

Yet this

frontispiece also registers some of the tensions, conflicts and redefinitions
evident in the literature of the period. Spenser’s Faerie Queen itself the great
seventeenth century heroic poem, and Paradise Lost treat the Fall of Man
and its tragic consequences. With its roots in Romanticism, antiquarianism
and the primacy of the imagination the Gothic genre originated in the 18th
century flourished in the 19th century and continued to thrive today.
The following is a survey of the English and European Gothic fiction.

43

2.3 Gothicism in Various Literatures:
The origin of Gothic literature is traced into various aspects like
culture, history and artistic precedents. Gothic elements are found in ancient
folklore such as demon lover, cannibal, bridegroom, devil and assorted
demons. The Gothic began in the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries. The Gothic tradition developed in the Romantic literature. These
works depicted religion and discouraged superstition by providing evidence
of the existence of good spirit, angels and divine manifestation by ridiculing
delusions and naïve credulity. When Gothic movement began, these
elements were present in the literature and folklore prior to the mideighteenth century. It was the political, social and theological landscape of
eighteenth century Europe that served as an impetus for the movement.
Writers composed Gothic narratives during this period largely in response to
anxiety over the change in social and political structure brought about by
such events as the French Revolution, the secular based government rapidly
changing the nature of everyday world by scientific advance and industrial
development rather than by folklore and fantasy. The Gothic works depicted
fears about what might happen, what could go wrong and what could be lost
by continuing along the path of political, social and theological changes as
well as reflecting the desire to return to the time of fantasy and belief in
supernatural intervention that characterized the Middle Ages. In some cases
Gothic narratives were used to depict horrors that existed in the old social
and political order - the evils of an unequal intolerant society. In Gothic
narratives, writers were able to both express the anxiety generated by this
upheaval and to increase society’s appreciation and desire for change and
progress.
44

The Gothic tradition in literature was contributed by the great
Romantic poets Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, John Keats and Samuel
Taylor Coleridge. Writers like William Godwin, Mary Shelley and others
are most closely associated with Gothic tradition. The Gothic tradition
influenced French authors including Gaston Leroux and Russian authors
including Fyodor Dostoevsky and Anton Chekhov. Since its inception the
gothic genre in literature has undergone numerous changes and adaptations
but its essential role as a means of depicting humanity’s deepest, darkest
fears and otherwise unspeakable evil was both real and imagined.
The English writers are credited to have founded the Gothic novel.
Scottish writers such as James Hogg contributed heavily to the genre and
many English language works were influenced by German literary
traditions, particularly the works of such writers as Johann Wolfgang von
Goethe and E.T.A. Hoffmann. Sir Walter Scott’s works reflect German and
Gothic sensibility. Horace Walpole, Ann Radcliff, Mary Shelley, Maturin
and Lewis wrote the finest Gothic novels. Charles Brokenden Brown, Edgar
Allan Poe, and James Fenimore Cooper and some of the most notable
authors developed what becomes the American Gothic tradition.
English Literature:
Christopher Marlowe (1564-1593) was a great playwright. His play
Doctor Faustus (1604) is a tragedy in blank verse. Dr. Faustus is weary of
scientific study and turns to magic. He promises a devil that he will give him
twenty four years of life if his desires are fulfilled. The bad angel Lucifer
shows him the pleasures of seven deadly sins. Next Faustus invokes the
ghost of Helen of Troy. In this story we find Gothic elements like
45

supernaturalism, angels, ghosts and at the end of the story, Faustus’s tragic
life explained. The climax of the play is Faustus’s monologue anticipating
the terror that awaits him in his last hour of life. One scene reads thus: “See
see where Christ’s blood streams in the firmament! One drop would save
soul, half a drop. Ah My Christ! and his descent into hell.”1
Samuel Richardson (1689-1761) was a great novelist. Clarissa (1748)
is his masterpiece. It tells the tragic story of a heroine, whose quest for virtue
is continually thwarted by her family. Her family forces her to marry a rich
but highly uncultured man Roger Solmes. So she escapes with Lovelace, but
she remains Lovelace’s prisoner for many months. She refuses to marry him
and he rapes her. However, Lovelace’s action backfires and Clarissa is even
more adamant on not marrying a vile and corrupt individual like Lovelace.
Eventually, Clarissa manages to escape from the brothel, but becomes
dangerously ill due to the mental duress she has been under for so many
months at the hands of “the vile Lovelace.” Clarissa is sheltered by the kind
but poor Smiths and during her sickness she gains another worshipper-John
Belford, another libertine who happens to be Lovelace’s friend. Belford is
amazed at the way Clarissa handles her approaching death and laments over
what Lovelace has done. In one of the many letters sent to Lovelace he
writes that “if the divine Clarissa asks me to slit thy throat, Lovelace, I shall
do it in an instance.”2 Eventually, surrounded by strangers and Col. Morden,
Clarissa dies in the full consciousness of her own virtue, and trusting in a
better life after death. Belford becomes the individual who manages
Clarissa’s will and ensures that all her articles and money go into the hands
of the individuals she desires should receive them after death.

46

Horace Walpole (1717-1797) is considered the outstanding chronicler
of his era. He is widely recognized as one of England’s first art historians,
and an influential revivalist of Gothic literature. His work The Castle of
Otranto (1764) pioneered the introduction of supernaturalism and mystery
into the romance and is thus considered as the first Gothic novel. The Castle
of Otranto under a mixture of impulses illustrates the movement of the
Gothic away from antiquarianism into as yet uncharted psychological
territories.
Richard Hurd (1720-1808) wrote Letters on Chivalry and Romance
(1762). “It provides critical justification for the literature of the Middle Ages
and the use of romance material in modern poetry by insisting that the
chivalry, manners and Gothic superstitions are more poetic than those of the
Greek heroic age.”3 Richard Hurd spoke favorably of Gothic poetry as well
as medieval chivalry and architecture, all of which had long been held in
contempt by the literati.
William Godwin (1756-1836) is remembered for his contribution to
the Gothic literary tradition. His best novel Things As They Are: or The
Adventures of Caleb Williams (1794) is a didactic tale about the evil of
government that borrows heavily from the popular Gothic fiction of the day.
His novel tells the story of Caleb Williams, a man persecuted by his
employer, Ferdinando Falkland, and jailed for a crime he did not commit.
Williams’ troubles begin when he learns that Falkland once committed
murder. When he confesses his discovery he gets swept up in a series of
events over which he has no control, as Falkland frames him for a capital
crime. Falkland is an important prototype of the seemingly benevolent but
cruel and morally bankrupt Gothic villain, a dual personality that
47

foreshadows Robert Luis Stevenson’s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The account
of Caleb’s imprisonment and exile is a calculated indictment of the horrors
of the British criminal justice.
William Blake (1757-1827) in his works like Songs of Experience
used the ideas of God and death along with several thoughts on the failure of
love and imagination. He wrote them through the Gothic style of darkness
and bitter despair that is usually born of contempt for people or society
itself.
William Beckford (1760-1844) is remembered for his novel Vathek
(1787), which is consistently hailed as a seminal contribution to the genre
called Romance. Backford wrote initially in French, revised and expanded
the work. An evil caliph Vethak travels to the underworld domain ruled by
Eblis, a satanic figure. There, Vathek seeks forbidden wisdom, only to face
eternal damnation in the Palace of Subterranean Fire. Beckford based many
of his characters upon historical figures and provided a wealth of oriental
detail, including descriptions of eastern customs, plant and animal life. He
intended to add to this story four episodic tales narrated by sufferers in the
Palace of Subterranean Fire. It is said, “The novel’s structure, themes and
symbolism place Vathek firmly in the tradition of Gothic fiction. Vathek
proper, obviously inspired by the Arabian Nights, recounts the Caliph
Vethak’s adventures with evil and final punishments.”4 Vethek is sometimes
whimsical, sometimes grotesque, and is written for the most part with an
ironic touch.
Joanna Baillie (1762-1851) is a Scottish poet, playwright, editor and
critic. Many of Baillie’s tragedies are Gothic works. Her one famous book is
48

Count Basil where De Monfort centers on a love triangle devoid of romantic
intentions which lead to a murder, while Orra tells the tale of a young,
independent heiress who refuses to wed and ultimately is driven mad by a
fake haunting designed to trick her into marriage. The characters in Count
Basil struggle to reconcile their desire for love and honor. Her work
Witchcraft (1836) focuses on three women identified as witches, one of
whom narrowly escapes being burned at the stake. The critics point to
Baillie’s use of the Gothic to critique the morals and values of her time,
especially with regard to traditional views of women. Baillie’s plays Count
Basil and De Monfort in particular, portray the tension wrought by upheaval
in aristocratic society and the threat such upheavals posed to traditional
gender roles.
Ann Radcliffe (1764-1823) is considered one of the most important
writers of the English Gothic tradition. She transformed the Gothic novel
from a mere vehicle for the depiction of terror into an instrument for
exploring the psychology of fear and suspense. With Radcliffe, Gothic
fiction became a craze. Her enormous popularity was associated with a
number of innovations. Her importance is further acknowledged by the fun
Jane Austen pokes at the delicious terror of Udolpho in Northanger Abbey.
Radcliffe’s best known novel The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794), ranks as one
of the chief examples of the Gothic genre. This novel contains all of the
classic Gothic elements including a haunted castle, a troubled heroine, a
mysterious and menacing male figure, and hidden secrets of the past. Claire
Buck writes, “Radcliffe interweaves concentration on the picturesque,
mystery and feeling, following the fashion set by Horace Walpole.”5 She
was acknowledged by critics of her time as the queen of the Gothic novel
49

and she was also considered a pioneer of the Romantic Movement. Radcliffe
is a key figure in the Gothic tradition that freed the collective English
literary imagination from conventional and rational constraints and ushered
in English Romanticism.
James Hogg (1770-1835) is a Scottish poet, novelist and short story
writer. He wrote The Private Memories and Confessions of a Justified
Sinner (1824) which during his life had been dismissed as an obtuse satire
on Christian fanaticism. Featuring Gothic and supernatural elements,
including a schizophrenic narrator and a psychological double-devil figure,
as well as proto modern narrative complexity the work has been
rediscovered by modern critics who have come to view it as a masterpiece of
prose fiction. The supernatural folk traditions represent Hogg’s best
achievements and also provide the most interest for modern readers. The
Barber of Duncow (1813), one of his best ghost stories, tells how a spirit
reveals to a new bride her husband’s profligate past.

After the wife

disappears, her husband’s ghost with throat nearly severed leads villagers to
her corpse and when the husband touches the body, it begins to bleed
profusely. We find in his work psychological complexity and deep ironic
and ambivalent element.
Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832) is a Scottish novelist, short story writer
and poet. He gave attention to Gothic qualities in his fiction. Scott urged his
readers to distinguish Waverley (1814) and the subsequent series of
Waverley novels from tales of Gothic horror. These works nevertheless
exhibit numerous affinities to the Gothic literary mode. The mysterious
workings of fate and the supernatural often depict violent clashes between
romantic and modern sensibilities. Scott’s fiction which makes broad use of
50

historical and frequently medieval settings alludes to the mysterious. It is
routinely cited for its substantial exploration of these and other Gothic
themes and devices. The Pirate (1822) set in the remote Orkney Islands in
1700 detailies a struggle between two half brothers. St. Ronan’s Well (1824)
depicted a brutal rivalry between half brothers. Castle Dangerous (1832)
concerned with the excesses of the late chivalric code. While many of the
Waverley novels provide hints of the supernatural, Scott generally relegated
his literary depiction of the inexplicable and other worldly to his short
fiction. Chronicles of the Canon Gate (1827) includes two darkly pessimistic
short stories. The first of this called ‘The Highland Widow’ is a tale. The
passing of the old Scottish way of life in the death of a widow’s son is
apparently caused by the supernatural power of a fatal curse. In the second
story, “The Two Drovers” misunderstanding coupled with the strange and
tragic workings of fate leads to the murder of an English cattle man by a
Scottish Drover and eventually to the Highlanders execution for his crime.
The Keepsake For 1829 (1829) includes Scott’s ghost story ‘The Tapestried
Chamber’ and the tale of sorcery ‘My Aunt Margaret’s Mirror,’ featuring a
magical mirror that allows gazes to witness important events as they
transpire miles away. Alexander Sanders thinks that Scott is still famous for
his historical fiction. He writes, “Scott’s novels, an epoch making
phenomenon in their own time, retain more of their original esteem.”6
Matthew Lewis Gregory (1775-1818) is a pivotal figure in the history
of Gothic novel. He may have been inspired by Ann Radcliffe. It is said, “If
Ann Radcliffe is the epitome of ‘female Gothic’, Lewis is the pattern of
masculine form.”7

Lewis’s novel The Monk (1796) is a notorious

eighteenth century novel of horror. He created genteel novels of suspense.
51

Lewis emphasized the graphic and the sensational. The Monk’s blend of
overt sexuality and terror created a scandal in England. His talent showed
him as an innovative writer of prose and poetry. He contributed to the
Gothic literary tradition as well as the development of the English Romantic
movement. The Monk proved so controversial in order to retain his position.
In this novel, Ambrosio is a protagonist, who is a monk. He is a well
respected figure in medieval Madrid. Rosario meets Ambrosio and reveals
that he is actually a woman named Matilda de Villanges, whose love for
Ambrosio has led her to disguise herself in order to be nearer to him. The
two consummate a sexual relationship, though Ambrosio later feels remorse
and disgust for his actions. After his interlude with Matilda, while visiting
the nearby convent of St.Clave, Ambrosio discovers that Agnes, a nun,
desires to elope with her lover, Don Raymond de las Cisternas. The monk
discloses this information to mother St.Agatha, prioress of the convent,
which punishes Agnes by imprisoning her in a dungeon beneath the convent.
Later, Ambrosio travels to the house of the ailing Donna Elvira Dalfa and
falls in love with her young daughter Antonia. With the aid of Matilda and
her knowledge of black magic, the monk summons a demon so that he might
violate the girl. Ambrosio returns to Donna Evilvira’s house, kills her and
abducts Antonia, now unconscious through the action of magical potion. In
the meantime, Agnes’s brother Lorenzo accuses Mother St.Agatha of
murdering his sister and wins a warrant for his arrest. An angry mob forms
in response to the accusation, and the crowd razes the convent, murdering
the prioress and many innocent nuns. Amid the chaos Leronzo enters the
convent grounds in search of his sister. When he finds her she is close to
death and clutching the decaying body of her dead child. Hearing the
screams of a young girl nearby, Lorenzo discovers Antonia’s ravished and
52

stabbed body and observes her attacker Ambrosio, as he flees; later he
notifies the Inquisition for Ambrosio’s crimes. Ordered to be burned at the
stake, Ambrosio, at the urgings of Matilda, makes a pact with Satan,
exchanging his soul for freedom. The devil appears and saves him from the
flames of the Inquisition, only to reveal that in killing Donna Elvira and
raping Antonia, he has murdered his own mother and committed incest with
his sister. The story ends as the monk’s forfeit soul is cast into hell. The
Monk departs somewhat from that of the traditional Gothic novel, while it
favors the evocation of grotesque horror rather than the rendering of a
sentimental theme of justice based upon divine providence. Lewis’s novel
nevertheless presents a critique of human vice and explores the conflict
between religion and human sexuality.
Charles Maturin (1780-1824) is remembered primarily for his novel
Melmoth the Wanderer (1820) which is considered among the finest
examples of Gothic fiction in English. He is known for his complicated
revenge plot, supernatural phenomena and use of landscape to create
atmosphere of horror and suspense. It is strongly reminiscent of the Gothic
novels by Radcliffe and Lewis. Melmoth the Wanderer tells the story of a
seventeenth century scholar who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for a
prolonged life. The critics praised the novel for its graphic description of
horror and suffering.
Jane Austen’s (1795-1817) Northanger Abbey (1818) is her only work
to be widely studied as part of the Gothic literary tradition. The novel is in
part a burlesque of the Gothic and sentimental fiction that was popular in the
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Northanger Abbey follows the

53

maturation of Catherine Morland, a naive eighteen-year-old ignorant of the
working of English society.
Mary Shelley (1797-1851) is best known for her novel Frankenstein;
or the Modern Prometheus (1818) which has transcended the Gothic and
horror genres and is now recognized as a work of philosophical and
psychological resonance. Shelley created a powerful metaphor for the
modern age; indeed, the Frankenstein myth, which has been adapted to
stage, film and television has pervaded modern culture. In addition to
Frankenstein, Shelley’s literary works include several novels that were
moderately successful when published but are little-known today. Students
of the Gothic, supernatural horror and science fiction novel have adopted
Frankenstein as a venerable forebear and have approached it from a
historical point of view. In Frankenstein, superstition and science, Gothic
magic and rational enquiry undergo a spectacular fusion. “It is a Gothic tale
of terror informed by the contemporary philosophical debate.”8
Charles Dickens (1812-1870) is an English novelist and social thinker.
He wrote a ghost story A Christmas Carol (1843). Some of the characters
are grotesques. Dickens loved the style of eighteenth century Gothic
romance. He was a late contributor to the development of Gothic literature.
However, he played a major role in establishing the Christmas ghost story as
an institution. Novels by Dickens that owe a debt to the Gothic tradition
include The Old Curiosity Shop (1841), Bleak House (1853), Little Dorrit
(1857) Great Expectations (1861), Mutual Friend(1865), and The Mystery of
Edwin Drood (1870). These novels contain Gothic elements within their
humorous, picaresque structure, employing melodrama, hyperbole and
horror to drive home their themes. The Mystery of Edwin Drood’s prime
54

suspect is John Jasper, uncle of the missing Edwin, who frequents opium
dens and conceals a secret passion beneath his seeming respectability. This
plot is Gothic.
Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, (1814-1873) is an Irish novelist, short story
writer and poet. Le Fanu is a major figure among Victorian authors of
Gothic and supernatural fiction. His novels and short stories are descriptions
of physical settings, powerful evocation of foreboding and dread and
convincing use of supernatural elements. Le Fanu’s works are admired for
their insightful characterization and skilled use of narrative. His first
collection of short stories Ghost Stories and Tales of Mystery (1851) and The
Purcell Papers show his supernatural and psychological interests. The five
longer stories in the later collection In a Glass Darkly (1872) are widely
acknowledged as his best work in the genre.
Charlotte Bronte (1816-1855) is the author of vivid skillfully
constructed novels. She created female characters who broke the traditional,
nineteenth century fictional stereotype of a woman as submissive and
dependent, beautiful but ignorant. Her works, depicting the struggles and
minor victories of every day life, are considered early examples of literary
realism. Jane Eyre and Villette (1853) have been discussed as a part of the
Gothic literary tradition and contain elements of mystery, heightened
passions and the supernatural.
Emily Bronte (1818-1848) is considered an important yet elusive
figure in the nineteenth century English literature. In Wuthering Heights
(1847) Bronte incorporated the horror and mystery of a Gothic novel the
remote setting and passionate characters of a Romantic novel, and the social
55

criticism of a Victorian novel. This story of extraordinary love and revenge
brought her recognition. In Wuthering Heights, Bronte chronicles the
attachment between Healthcliff, a rough orphan taken in by the Earnshaw
family of Wuthering Heights, and the family’s daughter Catherine. The two
characters are joined by a spiritual bond of preternatural strength, yet
Catherine elects to marry her more refined neighbor Edgar Linton of
Thrushcross Grange. Ultimately, this decision leads to Catherine’s madness
and death and prompts Heathcliff to take revenge upon both the Lintons and
the Earnshaws. Heathcliff eventually dies, consoled by the thought of
uniting with Catherine’s spirit and the novel ends with the suggestion that
Hareton Earnshaw, the last descendant of the Earnshaw family, will marry
Catherine’s daughter, Catherine Linton and abandon Wuthering Heights for
Thrushcross Grange. Today the novel is known for its “Gothic and romantic
elements. It has become one of the most popular and widely acclaimed of all
Victorian novels.”9
Willkie Collins (1824-1889) was a novelist, short story writer and
playwright. Collins is remembered as a principle founder of English
detective fiction. Collins has been called the father of English detective
fiction. His novels are known for intrigue and suspense. Collins began to
receive recognition for his innovations in the detective genre for his
unconventional representation of female characters. His first novel Antonina
was imitative and historical. Collins’s use of the Gothic recast history in this
tale. It focuses on the siege of patriarchal Rome by a Gothic army.
Bram Stoker (1847-1912) is best known as the author of Dracula
(1897). It is one of the most famous horror stories of all time and a work
frequently cited as a culminating example of the late-Victorian Gothic
56

fiction. Stoker wrote adventure novel, romances, works of horror and
numerous pieces of short fiction. Stoker composed Dracula as an epistolary
novel comprised of journal entries, letters, newspaper clippings; ships log
book and phonograph recordings. The story begins with the journey of a
young English solicitor, Janathan Harker. He is sent to Transilvania to
counsel a wealthy client Count Dracula. During his two month stay at
Dracula’s castle, Harker becomes disconcerted by Dracula’s odd
appearance, eccentricities and predatory behavior. After some investigation,
he discovers that Dracula sleeps in a coffin in a crypt beneath the castle
during the day and spends his nights stealing babies from the nearby town.
Harker manages to escape the castle and returns to England where he is
reunited with his fiancée Mina Murray. Strange events in London, including
the arrival of a Russian schooner containing fifty boxes of earth and
mysterious death of Mina’s acquaintance Lucy Westenra, suggest that
Dracula has followed Harker back to England. Harker engages the help of
Lucy’s former doctor, Von Helsing, when she reemerges as a vampire.
Together with several assistants the men locate the undead Lucy and destroy
her. Then it becomes clear that Mina is the victim. Discovering that he has
fled London, they track him and kill him. As Dracula’s body disintegrates,
Mina is saved. Dracula is a straightforward horror novel. Jean-Jacques
Lecercle in his essay “The Kitten’s Nose: Dracula and Witchcraft,”
comments that the novel is a “Greimassain account, involving a two-tier
analysis.”10 This is in terms of narrative techniques.
Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894) is a best known Scottish novelist
and short story writer. He is best known for his outstanding work of
supernatural horror The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886).
57

His famous stories of piracy and horror have placed him at the forefront of
writers of romance. His fiction is still considered seminal to the late 19 th
century development of adventure romance and Gothic literature. The Merry
Men and Other Tales and Fables (1887), Island Nights Entertainments
(1893), The Master of Ballantrae (1889), and Weir of Hermiston (1896)
examine moral dilemmas presented in an atmosphere imbued with mystery
and horror.
Oscar Wilde (1854-1900) is

one of the foremost figures of late

nineteenth century decadence, a movement whose members espoused the
doctrine of “art for art’s sake” by seeking to subordinate moral, political,
social concerns in art to matters of aesthetic value. Wilde’s novel The
Picture of Dorian Gray (1890) is typically considered one of the pictures of
defining literary works of the Decadent movement.
Joseph Conrad (1857-1924) is a writer of the best known novel Heart
of Darkness (1899). It is surprising to find Conrad employing such
traditional Gothic techniques to create an atmosphere of imminent terror.
However a short story like The Inn of the Two Witches (1915) provides a
clear revelation of Conrad’s acquaintance with and understanding of
Gothicism in its most basic form. In this tale Conrad charts the story of
Edgar Byrne and his search for young seaman, Tom Corbin, who has
disappeared in mysterious circumstance. Significantly setting his action in a
remote region of the early nineteenth century Spain, Conrad readily adopts a
number of Gothic conventions aimed at creating a mood of initial terror. A
sense of brooding oppression is achieved by Conrad’s references to the
“wild, gloomy sky” and the “rank,” “stony” and dreary” nature of the
surrounding landscape.”11 As Edgar Byrne’s search intensifies the Gothic
58

atmosphere correspondingly. Stumbling on a remote hamlet, Conrad’s
narrative notes that it is “hidden in a fold in the ground,” in spot which
seemed the most lonely corner of the earth and as if accursed in its
uninhabited barrenness”12 In such passages Conrad’s language, with its
heavy adjectival stress, is ideally suited to the Gothic form, which by
definition demands linguistic intensification or exaggeration. Michael Joslin
observes, “In characteristic Gothic fashion, Conrad’s landscape has become
“a Grotesque vision of hell.”13
Conrad’s opening narrative sequence in ‘The Inn of the Two Witches’
(1915) follows well-established Gothic formulas designed to create a mood
of initial error. In Heart of Darkness (1899), for example, one critic refers to
the “powerful impact of the setting” with its “aura of nightmarish
…gloom,”14 and adds significantly that its effect is as “startling as any
created in a recognized Gothic novel. Conrad’s stress on the reverberating
darkness, the almost evil animation of the trees, is strikingly Gothic in its
whole conception. Furthermore in this passage, it is significant to point to
what Ian Watt calls Conrad’s characteristic “inflation of language.”15 His
lavish imagery so typical in his descriptions of Africa and the tropics creates
an immediate sense of apprehension, and plays a major role in evoking a
mood of fear and terror. ‘Conrad’s Sea’ becomes as strangely mysterious
and as powerfully moving as the awesome castles and the sublime
mountains of the conventional terror novel.
Conrad’s Heart of Darkness is a narrative, with other two stories. The
story begins with a western character Marlow meeting at the trading post
and the central stations are only in extracting ivory and do not notice the
suffering of the native workers. Marlow is sent upriver to rescue Kurtz, an
59

agent, now seriously ill. His depravity is signaled by the human heads which
decorate the posts outside the hut. Marlow retains a paradoxical admiration
for Kurtz, whose death bed cry- ‘The horror! The Horror!- intimates a kind
of desperate self knowledge.
Dinesen Isak (1885-1962) is best known for his work Seven Gothic
Tales (1934). Isak explored such themes as the lives and values of
aristocrats, the nature of fate and destiny, the artist and the place of women
in society. Her works defy easy categorization, though she incorporated
elements of Gothic and horror as well as humor in her stories.
European Literature:
Gothic fiction is equally rich in the other European literatures like the
German and French. A few Gothic writers like Goethe, Hoffmann and Hugo
are mentioned in the following pages.
Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe (1749-1832) was a German poet,
novelist, playwright and short story writer. He was a shaping force in the
major German literary movements of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries. His drama Faust is considered one of the greatest works of
nineteenth century Romanticism. His work containing Gothic elements is his
two parts retelling of the classic legend of Faust, the scholar who gives
himself to Mephistopheles, or the devil, a chance to claim his soul in
exchange for unlimited knowledge and eternal life. Faust as a play lacks
almost totally the sadistic terror that was the visible hallmark of the Gothic.
Christopher Marlow wrote his play on the same theme and his Faustus is
more popular than Goethe’s.

60

Hoffmann E. T. A. (1776-1822) (Ernst Theodor Wilthelm Hoffmann
Amadeus) was a German novelist and short story writer. An artist Hoffmann
is best known as a writer of bizarre and fantastic fiction. Drawing on English
Gothic romance, Italian comedy, the psychology of the abnormal and occult,
he created a world in which everyday life is infused with the supernatural.
Hoffmann himself considered ‘Der goldene Topf’ in which the supernatural
enters the poet’s every day life, as his best piece of writing. Additional
stories in the Gothic tradition include Die Automate (1814), a two part tale
containing a ghost story and a mystery centering on an automation or robot,
and Die Abentue der Silvester-Nacht (1814,”A New Year’s Eve
Adventure”) in which two characters in two different settings represent
polarities of the same personality. Both stories contain supernatural
elements.
Victor Hugo (1802-1885) was a French poet, novelist and playwright.
He wrote Claude Gueux (1834), a documentary short story about a real life
murderer who had been executed in France, in 1834. Les Miserable (1862)
is a novel about social misery and injustice as early as the 1830’s.
American Literature:
During the period of 1765 American colonists had created a body of
writing which the modern literary historian finds by no means negligible.
There was no conscious demand for a national literature. The United States
was made to feel that a great literature was essential to the proof of a
nation’s greatness.

The first writers to be colonized as American classics

were Irving, Cooper and Bryant.

61

The difficulty was that while the new land supplied the writer with
rich and untouched materials, it gives him no technique for handling them.
The author had to learn from the European writers how to treat these
materials and he was thus bound to seem unoriginal. Eventually of course,
America would produce original writers like Poe, Whitman, Henry James,
Mark Twain, Hemingway, Faulkner and Nathaniel Hawthorne, who would
be valued by European writers and critics for their contributions to aesthetic
theory and literary technique.
Gradually the European Gothic was exported to America. It was in
the 18th century when writers and philosophers wondered, for the first time,
about the pleasurable effect of horror. There was a growing taste for ruins
and melancholy terror for graveyard poetry and for wild and desolated
scenery. The influential forms were public mode as the satire and the moral
essay. They dealt with everyday experience of men and women in society
and they addressed the reader with easy confidence. It was a polite art whose
ideals were clarity, precision, order and harmony. The surprising fact that
the Age of Reason, of balance, common sense could produce an imaginative
type of literature, such as the gothic, a literature of exaggeration and
violence. It is not so surprising once we have had a look at its history two
wars for colonial territories with Queen Anne, the Seven Years Wars with
George III and the French revolution and the subsequent threat of the
guillotine. Literature within the limits of reason is going to be replaced by a
literature of exaggeration and strong emotions. The fad for sentiment and
psychological states produced a lot of biographers and the taste for the
exotic produced a massive bulk of books of travels. The gothic novel was a
product of the times.
62

Edmund Burke was an Irish but sympathetic towards American
colonies. He defines the concept as : “Whatever is fitted in any sort to excite
the ideas of pain and danger, that is to say, whatever is in any sort terrible or
is conversant about terrible objects, or operated in a manner analogous to
terror is a source of the sublime, that is, it is productive of the strongest
emotion which the mind is capable of feeling.”16 Burke speaks of the delight
arising from scenes of distress, of terrible joy from the contemplation of
such objects as the silent night, the distant howling wilderness, the dark
wood and hanging precipice. This is connected with the feelings of the 18th
century travelers and with the poets of the so called graveyard poetry, then
in fashion. The American Novel is the guilt of the revolutionary haunted by
the paternal past which he has been striving to destroy and the fear that
possession of the gothic motivates its tone.”17
The vain of Gothic romances runs with the current of the domestic
and sentimental novel. The sentimental reveals the power of redemption and
the Gothic is the portrait of the power of darkness of damnation. Gothic
fiction attacks the institutions which might inhibit the freedom of the
individual. Corruption, greediness, lust are always projected in aristocrats or
priests. And all the symbols of authority, secular or ecclesiastic, are in ruins:
monasteries, churches, abbeys, castles, mansions, towers, ramparts. An age
that had killed kings and bishops was still afraid of the past, the dead could
keep on causing harm. Those are the ghost of the Gothic fiction. These
Gothic romances were not an analysis of contemporary manners, but a
vehicle for the irrationality of experience. Gothic fiction was entrusted the
task of conveying the impulses of the psyche whose earlier practitioners
could not find yet a satisfactory literary expression. The Gothic literature
63

had turned to the night side of the life, more appropriate to the horrors bred
by the Age of Reason. But Gothic literature in England was soon overcome
by the Romantic movement and then by the novels of manners by Jane
Austin and in the Victorian Age by Dickens, Thackeray, Wilde and Hardy
and many other novelists. Gothic fiction was soon forgotten. However what
was just a fad in England was taken by an incipient American literature and
developed, becoming soon a mode of expression and a common point of
view among the most important American writers.
At first sight it is really difficult to adapt a kind of fiction involved
with the past and history to a country that did not have any of these. The
haunted castles and ruined abbeys had sense in the European Gothic. They
were symbols for particular body of attitudes towards the past. But in
America all this was quite improbable. How could they be social status of
the hero or villain be transplanted, and aristocrats, the monks, the servants of
the Inquisition? How could they be convincingly introduced in the classless
American scene? How a country with so many future possibilities could be
concerned with the past?

America had not the gloom, the mysterious

element, and the decadence on which European writers fed. Hawthorne, in
the preface of the The Marble Faun refers to the “poverty of materials in
America by elaborating a catalogue of missing items like no shadow, no
mystery, no picturesque and gloomy wrong, nor anything but a
commonplace prosperity.”18 This makes the task of the writer of romances
specially difficult. However, there are only ten years between the publication
of the novels by Radcliff and Lewis and the first American Gothic romances.
American writers chose Gothic romance instead of other genres such as the

64

sentimental novel.

This could be explained by an account of common

features existing between Gothic literature and the historical in America.
If the essence of the Gothic hero is his lust for experience, that is
exactly the foundation of America. Both the Gothic hero and the earlier men
of America are men on the run, who flayed away from institution and
civilization to find a world of menaces. The Gothic hero is a rebel and he
challenges the rules and attacks institutions. He is therefore the enemy of
heaven. The very act by which America was established is a gesture of
defiance. But this breach of the primal taboo of breaking through the limits
produced a sense of guilt and anxiety, the guilt of breakthrough, whose
punishment was spiritual isolation. If the Gothic in England offered
conventions to embody a violent past, it will also fit America. Although
American past was recent, it did not lack violence and bloodshed, the
slaughter of the Indians, the revolutionary war and slavery. Through the
Gothic modes the obsessive concerns of American life could find
expression. Puritanism favored an allegorical habit of mind that suited the
symbolist nature of Gothic romances and provided with a solid basis the
problem of evil and damnation. Faust, the typical damned hero, is the
protagonist of gothic fiction. The struggle between the absolute good and the
absolute evil finds a suitable literary embodiment in the Gothic fiction when
it is made of language of static signs of tragedy in a vacuum.
Gothic fiction provided the American writers not with a fiction in the
novel form, but with romance. It was not likely that novels of manners found
in America favorable conditions since America did not have yet a fully
developed complex society. In romance, experience has less to do with
human beings as social creatures than as individuals. In romance there is no
65

firm sense of social arena. Romance and Gothic fictions apart from the
analytic mode of the novel, there is in them an explained element a mystery
in the alteration of character. Such writers as Cooper, William Gilmore
Simms and Hawthorne believed that romance was the form of fiction called
for by American conditions. Romance provided Hawthorne with that
“neutral territory between the real world and fairyland where the actual and
the imaginary my meet.”19
The American characters are victims of their own weakness or
obsessions. American literature used Gothic conventions to invest with
horror the vision of a chaotic and lost world, as a means of expressing such
deep issue of American history as the guilt of the revolutionist, the
relationship with the Indian and the Negro and with the nature. Darkness is
proclaimed the realm of literature on the basis that freedom is damnation.
The environment is always a trap for the characters. The relationship
between the characters is founded on misconceptions the revolt or traditional
fixed concepts, the role of the hero, the behavior of institutions and nature. It
is the revolt of identity, of faith, of objects, of reliance on the characters’
view. There the American dream turns into the Faustian nightmare.
The British fiction influenced the American fiction so naturally that
American fiction resembles the European fiction. This also applies to the
American Gothic fiction. Generally Charles Brockden Brown (1771-1810) is
remembered as the first American novelist and he is a key figure in the
tradition of Gothic for some of his novels like Edgar Huntly (1799), Wieland
Part I (1798), Part II (1801), Ormond (1799) and Merwin. He was
responsible for “Americanizing” the Gothic. It means his Gothic novels deal
with horror and supernatural elements with a peculiar American flavor,
66

replacing the expected tropes of European Gothic with American images,
including the frontier caves and cliffs. He located the sources of terror and
retained a Gothic mood of emotional and psychological extremity. Brown’s
novel Weiland is widely considered the first Gothic novel in America and it
is a tale of illusion, confusion and irrational human behavior. It is written in
epistolary form. It draws on the traditions of both Gothic and sentimental
novel, often considered convoluted and episodic, though highly imaginative.
It includes combustion, mass murder, suicide, seduction, insanity and
ventriloquism. Weiland is about an archetypal heroine Clara Weiland whose
peaceful life with her brother Theodore hears the voice command him to kill
his wife and children, which he does. He is about to murder his sister and the
man she loves. But shockingly, he was not responsible for the voice that
commanded Theodore to murder his family. Weiland has been seen
variously as a cautionary tale on the dangers of religious fervor, an
indictment of Puritanism and self referential allegory of the writing process
itself. Brown’s next novel Edgar Huntly deals with the problems of human’s
inability to trust his sense perception. The narrator follows Sleepwalking
Huntly, whom he suspects is his best friend’s murderer, through labyrinthine
frontier. His journey symbolizes the moral dilemma at the core of the novel;
whether criminology can begin to fathom a mind in nightmarish conflict.
Ormond deals with Brown’s ideas regarding necessity of educational
equality for women. The villainous Ormond terrorized Constantina Dudley
after having had her killed, holding her captive and threatening to rape her.
But she defeats him by sibling him. In Arthur Meruyn, the story has been
interpreted as Brown’s argument for civic responsibility toward the
impoverished, the ill and downtrodden.

67

Washington Irving (1783-1859) explored a number of literary styles
and genres in writing with many of his best known stories incorporating
elements like Gothic literature. Such stories were written in a humorous,
lighthearted tone; and they reveal the author’s interest in mystery, horror and
the supernatural. Most modern critics classify Irving as one of the greatest
American writers, responsible for establishing an American style of writing,
especially in the short story genre. His short stories like “The Adventure of
the German Student” have received attention for their unique handling of the
supernatural and the Gothic.
One of the acknowledged masters of American fiction is Nathaniel
Hawthorne (1804-1864). His works reflect his dark vision of human nature.
He portrays Puritanism as an expression of humanity’s potential for cruelty,
obsession and intolerance. His strange hunting tales of guilt, isolation and
death betray depths of human psychology and moral responsibility. His
highly allegorical works use of Gothic conventions to explore questions
about human actions and their consequence and effect of sin on the human
psyche. Gothic elements found in his novels The Scarlet Letter (1850) and
The Marble Faun (1860). These works are highly symbolic, challenging
moral fantasies. In his novel The Scarlet Letter, the Gothic elements and
devices abound, which treat cruel and unusual punishment of an adulteress.
In The Scarlet Letter, He set the standard for psychological realism for
generations of writers.

Hawthorne explored the historical, social,

theological and emotional ramifications of sin, concealment and guilt. He
used Gothicism as a vehicle to investigate the dark side of human soul, not
terrifying readers but horrifying them with clinical depiction of the inner
workings of his characters’ minds. In the words of Spiller, “In his exposition
68

of these complicated problems Hawthorne frankly employed fiction to study
psychic case histories; in him, as already hinted, was a tough, cold streak,
tempting him outside the personal relationships of his characters into
indefatigable analyses of these specimens of moral experience. It is true that
this semi scientific study sometimes chills the characters themselves, even in
the richly human Scarlet Letter.”20
Edgar Allan Poe’s (1809-1849) status as a major figure in the world
literature is primarily based on his highly acclaimed short stories, poems and
critical theories. Poe made himself known not only as a superlative author of
poetry and fiction but also as a literary critic whose level of imagination and
insight had hither to be unapproached in American literature. In poetry this
single effect must arise the readers’ sense of beauty, an ideal that Poe is
closely associated with; in prose the effect should be one revelatory of some
truth as in a tale of ratiocination or works evoking terror, or passion or
horror. Poe’s stories The Black Cat (1843), The Cask of Amontilloado
(1846) and The Tell Tale Heart (1843) are often told by a first person
narrator, and through this device, he probes the workings of a character’s
psyche. This technique foreshadows the psychological explorations of
Fyodor Dostoevsky and the school of psychological realism. In his Gothic
tales Poe employed an essentially symbolic almost allegorical method which
gives such work as The Fall of the House of Usher (1839), The Masque of
the Red Death (1842), and Ligeia (1838) an enigmatic quality that accounts
for their enduring interest and also links them with the symbolical works of
Hawthorne and Melville. A tale of sickness, madness, incest and the danger
of unrestrained creativity, The Fall of the House of Usher is among Poe’s
most popular and critically examined horror story. This story has a
69

psychological element and ambiguous events including symbolism that have
given rise to many critical readings. Poe used the term ‘arabesque’ to
describe the ornate descriptive prose in this and other stories. The story is
also one of the several of Poe’s which utilize as a central character the
Decadent Aristocrat. This mad, often artistic noble heir took the place of the
traditional Gothic villain in tales portraying the sublime hostility of
existence itself rather than the evil embodied by individuals. In addition to
The Fall of the House of Usher such characters appear in his stories like
Metzengerstein (1840), Berenice (1840), Ligeia (1838), The Oval Portrait
(1842) and The Masque of the Red Death (1842). Central to the setting in
many of these stories is a large ominous castle. A second group of Poe’s
tales centre, in obsessive detail, on the horror and misery wrought by a guilty
conscience. These included The Black Cat, The Tell-Tale Heart and William
Wilson. While the stories Hop-Frog: Or the Eight Chained OrgangOutrages (1849), The Pit and the Pendulum (1843) and The Cask of
Amontillado do not take a guilty conscience as their starting point. They
share the same paranoid intensity demonstrated in these tales. Poe’s poem
The Raven (1845), exhibits elements of tales in both groups identified above.
Poe completed only one novel and it was written in the Gothic tradition.
Poe’s The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym (1838), the story of an ill-fated
sea voyage has captured the attention of generations of readers with its
action packed-plot, imaginative use of symbol and myth, depiction of
cannibalism and numerous unusual occurrences.
Herman Melville (1819-1891) is best known for Moby Dick, a whale
hunting yarn that reaches into the dark Gothic depths of the psyche. He is
not ordinarily categorized as a Gothic writer and his relationship to the
70

literary tradition has nevertheless been identified by numerous contemporary
scholars who paint to the frequently adapted use of Gothic. We find his
exploitation of isolated shipboard settings for the purpose of evoking
psychological terror. These works have been a recent appreciation of Gothic
features in Melville’s novels. By the middle of the 20th century Moby Dick
was considered one of America’s greatest novels and widely acclaimed as a
work of genius. Melville elevated Moby Dick to the status of a national epic.
This work has been a recent appreciation of Gothic features. His adopted
Gothic fictional techniques evoke a mood of preternatural terror to the
shipboard. Moby Dick is informed by Gothic themes, conventions and
characterization. Melville uses the seagoing pequod as a surrogate for the
archetypal hunted castle setting of Gothic fiction.
Ambrose Bierce (1842-1914) is a well-known short story writer. His
story The Damned Thing (1898) focuses on how the human race takes its
views of nature for granted and how there are things in the natural world.
The human eye cannot see or the human ear cannot hear. It presents a
number of Gothic elements throughout. Some of the Gothic elements include
revealing what culture does not want to tell or admit and spreading social
anxieties. The story proceeds to entries written in Margan’s dairy.
Henry James (1843-1916), best known for his realistic fiction, wrote a
number of ghost stories including a couple of the more important works in
the tradition. At the turn of the century, James took the psychological ghost
story to a new height as it focuses not on external specters but on the
perceiving consciousness. James probed social and psychological concerns
such as artistic role of society, both need for the aesthetic and moral life.
James’s best known Gothic novel is The Turn of the Screw (1898); and the
71

ghost stories are The Ghostly Rental (1876) and The Jolly Corner (1908).
The Turn of the Screw is considered a landmark in Gothic tradition. By
common consent, it is a tale of supernatural horror. It is framed with a
speaker, Douglas, who produces a manuscript by a governess who had been
infatuated with her employer. She is confronted by a pair of ghost that she
suspects is corrupting the two young children in her charge. The apparitions
are those of Peter Quint, a man formerly employed in the household, and
Miss Jessel, a previous governess. As the suspicions deepen, the new
governess confronts each of the children; concerning their collusion with
ghost during each confrontation. One of the specters appears to the
governess, bringing the action to a crisis. The girl Flora denies having seen
the wraiths and apparently hysterical, is sent to her uncle in London. The
boy, Miles dies in the arms of governess during the culmination of a psychic
battle between the governess and the ghost of Peter Quint. In this story,
James once again leaves the nature and reality of the supernatural and the
story has been read variously as a horrifying ghost story and a penetrating
psychological study of an emotionally unstable woman whose visions of
ghost are mere hallucinations.
Perkins Gilmans Charlotte (1860-1935) was a short story writer. He
wrote The Yellow Wallpaper (1892). This is considered his best work of
short fiction. The story is about a young mother’s mental deterioration. The
unnamed protagonist of the story is advised on medical theories of the time
to abstain from any and all physical activity and intellectual stimulation. She
is suffering from post-partum depression. She is not allowed to read, write
and even see her new born baby.

Edith Wharton (1862-1932) is an important American writer. She is
best known as a novelist of manners whose fiction depicts the aristocratic
society in the United States at the beginning of twentieth century. Her short
stories reflect her concern for the status of woman in society as well as for
the moral decay. Aside from her numerous supernatural stories collected as
Ghost in 1937, Wharton’s writings eschew over Gothic machinery, while
many nevertheless evoke the pervasive and elemental sense of foreboding
and psychological terror typically associated with the genre. Her Ethan
Frome is notable for enveloping atmosphere of decay, and gloom and it
reflects several of the Gothic themes that she explored more fully in her
short stories.
Gertrude Atherton (1857-1948) is an American novelist and short
story writer. He wrote a Gothic story The Striding Place (1896). It follows
Weigal, who is part of a hunting party in England and goes out later to walk
and think. His best friend has disappeared couple of days earlier and while
Weigal is almost sure that it is a prank. He is still nervous. He goes down to
the river and follows the path through the woods at night. And his terror and
fear are explained in this story. Sherwood Anderson (1876-1941) is a short
story writer. Death in the Woods is a Gothic story written by him. The story
is the narrator’s fictionalized account for her life and death, focusing on one
fateful trip into a town. The Outsider (1921) is a short story about horror,
written by H. P. Craft (1890-1937). Here a mysterious man has been living
alone to discover that he is actually dead and the castle is his grave. The
story combines horror, fantasy and Gothic fiction to create a truly
nightmarish atmosphere, containing themes of loneliness

73

William Faulkner (1893-1962) is a pre-eminent figure in the twentieth
century American literature. Faulkner created a profound and complex body
of work that examines exploitation and corruption in the American South.
His use of bizarre, grotesque and violent imagery, melodrama and
sensationalism to depict the corruption and decay of the region makes him
one of the earliest practitioners of the sub-genre known as southern Gothic
literature. Faulkner’s works that are especially well known for their Gothic
qualities, include the novels Sanctuary (1931), Light in August (1932),
Absalom, Absolom! (1936), As I Lay Dying (1930) and the short story A
Rose for Emily (1930). They combine burlesque and dark humors with
realism and elements of the horrific and macabre to caricature a society that
is unable to break from its past and look to the future. Faulkner employs
Gothicism then as a search in social critique using it to paint a picture of a
culture in ruins, populated by grotesque and living ghosts who refuse to
recognize their alienation. As I Lay Dying charts the journey of a poor family
to bury their mother, Addie Bundren in Jefferson. Faulkner’s acclaimed
horror story A Rose for Emily is considered an exemplary work of Southern
Gothic fiction.
Russian Literature:
The ‘Occult’ (a term often interchanged with ‘esoteric’) according
Bernice Rosenthal may be said encompassing the occult sciences (alchemy,
astrology and magic), the Kabbala and the post-Renaissance doctrine of
Rosicrucian’s spiritualism, theosophy and Anthroposophy. One offshoot of
this was the concept of a living nature which may be related to
Naturphilosophie and the ‘cosmic pantheism’ of Schillings. There was a
considerable vague for the occult in late nineteenth century Russia but the
74

eighteenth century influx of freemasonry and esoteric elements within the
Romantic movements were also important. In addition to the concept of
dvoemirie, Russia had the phenomenon of dvoeverie (dual faiths), the
coexistence or blending of paganism with Orthodox Christianity. However,
it is primarily what Rosenthal calls the ‘Practicle Side’ of the Occult – the
attempt to enlist invisible or supernatural forces, divine or diabolic, to attain
health, wealth, love and other personal goals that really brings into
convergence with Gothic.
On the psychological side, the accentuation may fall on character
analyses or on a crisis of identity often introducing the Doppelganger which
in its turn may resolve itself into a supernatural or a psychological elements
of dream and fantasy. Greater concentration on setting may define ‘historical
Gothic’ or if contemporaneous ‘society or social Gothic.’ Other emphases
again, may lead to lead to ‘horror’ or ‘criminal Gothic.’ The idea of the
‘carnival world of the Gothic’ prompts consideration of Gothic in terms of
the theories of Mikhail Bakhtin. A yet further sub-division is identifiable as
‘artistic Gothic’ in which Gothic elements are involved with or subordinated
to them from art or music bringing into play artistic works or figures,
painting, musical composers or works like animation of images or statues. In
all such cases, some elements of the basic or classic Gothic ingredients need
to be present, for the term ‘Gothic’ to remain justifiable. Beyond these
widely attested categories of the European Gothic tale, vestigial Gothic
traces are to be found throughout what is considered mainstream realist
European fiction over the whole of the nineteenth century leading towards a
subsequent Neo-Gothic revival in the main coincidental with symbolism and
fin de siecle Decadence.
75

European elements were, then an important factor throughout the
evolution of English Gothic. French too was the language of composition of
manuscript found in Saragossa an extraordinary framed compilation of
stories reflecting the darker side of a burgeoning European Romanticism
written between 1797 and 1815 by the Polymath Polish nobleman Jan
Potocki. Alexander Bestuzhev wrote three horror tales that contain elements
of Russian folklore and were influenced by the Gothic works of Walter Scott
and Ann Radcliff. His tales of Caucasus are filled with authentic details on
the history and cultures of the region, including information on the dialects
of the area, which he quickly mastered on various ethnic customs and modes
of welfare.
Pushkin, Lermontove and Gogal are represented as minor figures of
Russian prose. V. E. Vatsure is the leading Russian commentator on the
gothic. Russian Gothic can be said to drive from an amalgam of European
influence on English Gothic novel, the tales of Hoffmann, the French
Fantastigue and Frenetigue traditions and the various schools of European
idealism. Pushkin is considered the founder of modern Russian literature. In
his novel, we find the theme of good versus evil. His novel The Queen of
Sheba is perceived as a supernatural tale evinced by the presence of the
magic cards, a winking corpse and countess’s ghost. Nikolai Gogal’s novel
Dead Soul is a satire. His stories often interweave pathos and mockery.
Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) was a Russian writer widely regarded as
among the greatest. Tolstoy is one of the giants of Russian literature. His
masterpieces War and Peace (1812) and Anna Karenina represent in their
scope, breadth and vivid depiction of nineteenth century Russian life and
attitudes. War and Peace shows the influence of the Gothic evocation of its
76

battle scenes: suffering, injury, terrible situations and death. The novel
explores theory of history and in particular the insignificance of individuals
such as Napoleon and Alexander. Tolstoy did not consider War and Peace to
be a novel. This view becomes less surprising if one considered that Tolstoy
was a novelist of the realist school who considered the novel to be a
framework for the examination of social and political issues in nineteenth
century life. A large portion of War and Peace focuses on war, which is
associated in our minds with clear-headed strategy and sensible reasoning.
Tolstoy constantly emphasizes the irrational motives for human behavior in
both peace and war. Wisdom is linked not to reason but to an acceptance of
how mysterious our actions can be even to ourselves. General Kutuzov
emerges as a great leader not because he develops a logical plan and then
demands that everyone follow it, but rather because he is willing to adapt to
the flow of events and think on his feet. He revises his plan as each stage
turns out to be vastly different from what was expected. Similarly irrational
actions include Nicholas’s sudden decision to wed Marry after previous
resolving to go back to Sonya and Natasha’s surprising marriage to Pierre.
Yet almost all the irrational actions we see in the novel turn out successfully
in accordance with instincts in human life that, for Tolstoy lie far deeper
than our reasoning minds.
Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821-1881): Russian Gothicism as a term has
not until recently enjoyed a great deal of currency in critical studies of
Russian literature. The word ‘Gothic’ is commonly used in connection with,
for an instance, certain early works by Russian novelist, journalist and short
story writer Fyodor Dostoevsky or to a lesser extent of his later and more
famous novels, which may be recognized as including Gothic elements.
77

During the more depressing stretches of which even Romanticism and
Dostoevsky were dirty words and critical energies were certainly not to be
expended on the Gothic. Furthermore the burgeoning of interest in Gothic as
a literary style even in the West is still comparatively recent. Dostoevsky’s
psychological penetration into the human soul had a profound influence on
the 20th century novel. Gothicism plays an important role in Dostoevsky’s
fictional world; it is not initially evoked through narrative accounts of
bizarre or exotic locations. Landscape, in the traditional sense, plays
virtually no part in Dostoevsky’s fiction. Descriptions of the natural world
are noticeably absent in his writing. It is said, “Dostoevsky is a writer of the
city and his landscapes are predominantly urban and human. The novels
Crime and Punishment (1866) and The Idiot (1869) are fantastic. In many
senses he highlights the Gothic identity. The St. Petersburg of Crime and
Punishment is the ideal Gothic backdrop for Raskolnikov’s horrific murders
of the pawnbroker and her sister.”21 The St. Petersburg of The Idiot (1869)
similarly highlights the Gothic aspects of Dostoevsky’s art.
Nikolay Karamzin (1766-1826) was a Russian short story writer. His
original stories include Poor Liza (1792) and Natalia the Boyar’s Daughter
(1792). Both introduce Russian readers to sentimentalism, and Karamzin
was hailed as ‘a Russian Sterne.’ His The Island of Bornholm is one of the
best known Gothic short stories of Russian literature. Alexandr Bestuzhev
(1797-1837) was Russian writer and Decembrist. His works are published
under the pseudonyms ‘Cossack Marlinsky’ and ‘Alexandr Bestuzhev
Marlinsky.’ His popularity waned after the middle of the nineteenth century.
His work was briefly revived in his own country in the middle of the
twentieth century but has been largely forgotten elsewhere in the world.
78

Vladimir Fyodorovich Odoevsky (1803-1869) was a prominent Russian
philosopher, writer and critic. His short stories The Last Suicide and The
Town with No Name are interlaced with philosophic conversations redolent
of the French encyclopedists.
Nikolai Gogol (1809-1852) was a Russian novelist and dramatist. He
wrote the novel Dead Souls (1842) which is a satire about serfdom and
bureaucratic inequities in which he hoped to castigate abuses and guide his
countrymen through laughter. Pushkin’s death produced a strong impression
on Gogol. After the triumph of Dead Souls, Gogol came to be regarded by
his contemporaries as a great satirist who lampooned the unseemly sides of
Imperial Russia. Little did they know that first part represented the Inferno,
the second part was to depict the gradual purification and transformation of
the rogue Chichikov under the influence of various publicans. The main
characteristic of Gogol’s writing is his impressionist vision of the reality and
of the peoples. He saw the outer world romantically metamorphosed a
singular gift particularly evident from the fantastic spatial transformations in
his Gothic stories, A Terrible Vengeance and A Bewitched Place.
Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov (1814-1841) a Russian Romantic
writer, poet and painter sometimes called ‘the poet of the Caucasus’ was the
most important Russian poet after Alexander Pushkin. His poetic
development was unusual. His earliest poems are in the pornographic, in the
extreme with elements of sadism. Lermontov’s best known poem, The
Demon (1841) is about an angel who falls in love with a mortal woman. It
reflected the poet’s self-image as a demonic creature.

79

Anton Chekhov (1860-1940) is considered to be one of the greatest
short story writers in the world of literature. Chekhov found literary
expression for the hell of Sakhalin in his long short story “The Murder,” the
last section of which is set on Sakhalin, where the murderer Yokov loads
coal in the night, longing for home.
Even an anthology entitled Russian Nineteenth Century Gothic Tales
compiled by Valentin Korovin and published by Ruduga in Moscow in 1984
seems to have acquired that title for its English language edited by chance.
The range of stories included extends from Antoni Pogorelskii and Orest
Somove in the 1820’s to Vladimir Odoevski’s The Living Corpse in 1844.
Pushkin, Lermontove and Gogol are represented as well as a number of
minor figures of Russian prose. The blurb to this collection, which has no
general introduction, refers to enchanting flights of the imagination, vivid
imagery borrowed from folk tale and legend, grotesque fantasy and utopian
dreams of a distant happy future. While all this may be in common with
western definitions of the Gothic, we may prefer to stress alternative feature,
old castles, hapless maidens, wicked and grasping relatives and mysteries.
V. E. Vatsuro, the leading Russian commentator on the ‘Gothic’ nominates
“‘Gothic heroes’ conflict and basic motifs and technique of mystery as the
basic props of the Gothic narrative, with the castle and incest, for instance,
as important subsidiary motifs.”22 It is said, “A certain input from folklore
and such further native medieval ingredients as chronicles and saints lives
apart, Russian Gothic can be said to drive from an amalgam of European
influence -- the English Gothic novel, the tales of Hoffmann, the French
Fanttique and Frenetigue traditions and the various schools of European
idealist and esoteric thought.”23

Other Literatures:
The Gothic fiction elsewhere in the world is rich enough for our
understanding and appreciation. But the problem is that, much of that is not
available in English or any other major world languages. Secondly, it is not
studied properly in those smaller languages. The Gothic literature is rich,
apart from European countries, in Asia, Africa and rest of the world. For
example, the Gothic fiction in Indian and Chinese languages is rich enough;
but the same aforesaid problems.
The following is an account of the Gothic fiction in Australia.
Australian literature began soon after the settlement of the country by
Europeans. Common themes include indigenous and settler identity,
alienation, exile and relationship to place but it is a varied and contested
area. Australia has a rich tradition of tales of horror and the supernatural
dating back to the mid-1800s. James Doig, editor of Australian Gothic
Anthology spoke to articulate about his quest to unearth classic Australian
horror. One theme in Australian Gothic tales is about a child lost in the bush
and falling prey to some supernatural manifestation, symbolic, perhaps of
European colonists naively blundering into a harsh unforgiving landscape
and suffering the consequences. The best known of these is probably Rosa
Praed’s ‘The Bunyip’ which has been anthologized many times and still
retains an authentic haunting quality. There are also haunted house stories
though in an Australian setting. Many of the early tales were set in the bush
or the outback rather than cities. There was an alien otherworldly quality
about the back of beyond that fired the imaginations of settlers and writers
alike. Australia was a frontier society and the bush more so than the city,
81

was a dangerous place. On the other hand, modern tales of terror are more
often set in the cities. The embodiment of evil has changed serial killers,
mass murderers, child murderers, homicidal lovers, that sort of thing. And
evil lurks within them. The themes are more universal than regional.
Tasmanian Gothic is an artistic genre. Although it deals with the themes of
horror and the uncanny, it differs from the European horror tradition rooted
in medieval imagery, crumbling mansions and ancient rituals. Frederick
Sinnett, writing in 1856, considered Gothic romanticism inappropriate to
Australian literature precisely because the colony lacked the requisite
antiquity. For many, however the very landscape of Australia was Gothic. A
unique creature of Australian legend is the bunyip. It is also called a ‘devil,
debil-debil.’ Descriptions vary widely but have many common features. For
example, in “Ironbark,” Bill meets the Bunyip. The creature is described as
about ten feet long with a body like a Murray cod with gleaming golden
yellow scales flippers like a crocodile and the head of a man. His hair was
coarse and long like a horse’s mane. The creatures lurk in water holes,
swamps, creeks and similar areas. They give off a blood curdling cry when
they devour any creature that ventures too close to their home. Another
common feature of Australian horror fiction is the cry of ‘coo-ee.’ It is a call
used in the bush but it often appears in fiction as an eerie cry announcing
death or warning against it. The cry is such a cultural icon that one writer
William Sylvester Walker used “Coo-ee” as his pseudonym.
Earlier popular works tended to be of the ripping yarn variety telling
tales of daring-to-do against the new frontier of the Australian outback.
Writers such as Rolf Boldrewood, Marcus Clarke and Joseph Furphy
embodied these stirring ideals in their tales and particularly the latter tried
82

accurately to record the vernacular language of the common Australian.
These novelists gave valuable insights into the penal colonies which helped
from the country and also the early rural settlements. Australia’s first novel
Quintus Servington (1830–31), written by the convicted English forger
Henry Savery (1791–1842), was a thinly disguised autobiography designed
to demonstrate how his fictional equivalent was different from the general
convict population. Those darker aspects of his existence are therefore
subdued, and the text is somehow less Gothic in nature than Savery’s own
life. Not so Anna Maria Bunn’s (1808–99) The Guardian: A Tale by an
Australian (1838), the first novel printed and published in mainland
Australia and the first by a woman. Though a Gothic romance, The
Guardian manages to display impatience with this aspect of the story, so that
it shifts into a range of modes, from the epistolary tale to the Comedy of
Manners. Indeed, Bunn seems to hold the not uncommon view that the
Gothic is somehow beneath contempt and frivolous, so that she is careful to
justify its use as reflecting the immorality of her characters and their
situation. Ironically, the novel is set in Ireland and Britain and refers
frequently to Australia only to condemn it. Australia is a land to which
graceless and incompetent individuals are exiled. As one character laments,
“All lost characters are found there.” The Guardian is the first of a series of
dark romances which make use of a Gothic sensibility, to speak, directly or
indirectly, about the Australian landscape. Numerous Gothic romances
emerged to fill a demanding interest in such texts, many derivatives and
flawed others quite successful in their execution. Some worthy of note
include British-born Mary Theresa Vidal’s (1815–69) Bengala (1860) and
the delightfully Gothic Outlaw and Lawmaker (1893) written by the prolific,
Australian-born Rosa Praed (1851–1935). Undoubtedly one of the oddest of
83

these numerous texts and one of the most offensive concerning matters of
race is Edward Sorensen’s The Squatter’s Ward (1919) which perhaps most
literally transposes the stock conventions of the Gothic tale into the
Australian landscape to include a home with trap-doors and underground
chambers where the master and his black servant dine. Poised on the
borderline of old and new worlds, such novels suggest much about the
struggle early colonial writers faced in finding a local and useful mode of
expression to speak their place. They also reveal the prejudices which
framed the way many colonists saw the new world. The Gothic, however,
may well have played a part in the process which reversed such views.
For Marcus Clarke (1846–81), the Gothic was a way to invest
Australia with a living history, by turning to detailed research on
transportation and convict conditions, stories of cannibalism and rape,
betrayal and suffering, as a way to frame his story of hardship and
redemption enacted in an Australian landscape (as he does, for example, in
his best-known work His Natural Life, 1870). Even before this, Clarke had
described Australia in terms which invoke a Gothic sensibility.
However, these writers were given their contribution to Gothic
literature. Their work depicts Gothicism in various ways. They used
Gothicism in supernatural elements, mystery, suspense horror, detective,
cathedral and many others.

<p> 10 Elements of Gothic Literature </p>
<p> Gothic literature first appeared in the late 18th century, and became one of the first literary genres to inspire broad popular enthusiasm. Though the first examples were fiction, poets also incorporated gothic elements, and the genre remained prevalent throughout the 19th century and into the 20th. For those who wish to study gothic literature -- or try their hand at composing it -- 10 elements appear as hallmarks of the form. </p>
<p> Fascination With the Past </p>
<p> Gothic writers romanticized the past, particularly the medieval era. Castles often feature prominently, as in Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein” and Horace Walpole’s “The Castle of Otranto.” This gothic fascination with the past also manifested in historical settings, such as the early 18th century Scotland of Sir Walter Scott’s Waverley novels. </p>
<p> The Supernatural </p>
<p> Supernatural elements also feature prominently in gothic literature. M.R. James' gothic ghost stories, published in the early 20th century, can be seen as a reaction against the rise of technology and science. Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” with its ghostly ship, showcases the supernatural in gothic poetry. </p>
<p> Emphasis on Sexuality </p>
<p> In the chaste Victorian era, Gothic literature provided an outlet for the exploration of sexuality. This appears in the trope of the doomed romance, as in Edgar Allan Poe’s “Annabel Lee,” or in the appearance of a demonic lover figure, such as the bloodthirsty vampire in Bram Stoker’s “Dracula.” </p>
<p> Horror </p>
<p> Many of gothic literature’s most influential works make heavy use of horror elements. Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein,” with its graveyards, gloomy castle and iconic monster, became a bestseller upon its first single-volume publication. Robert Louis Stevenson’s “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” and Ann Radcliffe’s “The Mysteries of Udolpho” also provide examples of gothic horror. </p>
<p> Psychological Portraits </p>
<p> Themes of madness and emotional distress characterize the psychological emphasis of gothic literature. As the genre matured into the 20th century, writers began to portray the internal horror of psychosis, as in Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s “The Yellow Wallpaper.” Poe’s “The Telltale Heart,” which examines the psychology of guilt, stands as an earlier example of this tendency. </p>
<p> Exotic Locales </p>
<p> Exotic settings featured in some of the earliest gothic works, and remained a key element throughout the genre’s history. William Bedford’s “Vathek,” set in the Middle East, helped popularize Orientalism, a 19th century fascination with Arabic and Asian cultures. </p>
<p> Experimental Techniques </p>
<p> The development of gothic literature paralleled that of the novel as art, and reached its apogee in the first half of the 20th century. Gothic literature contains experimental techniques such as shifting narrators and literary tableaux. Shifting narrators -- such as those in William Faulkner’s Southern gothic “As I Lay Dying" -- give different perspectives on the plot. A literary tableaux -- a description of a static scene -- can establish mood or convey symbolism. </p>
<p> The Gothic Hero </p>
<p> Gothic literature popularized the notion of the anti-hero, a flawed protagonist who incorporates dark or monstrous elements. Lord Byron featured gothic heroes in many of his works, including “Childe Harold” and “Manfred.” Emily Bronte’s “Wuthering Heights” contains a prominent gothic hero in Heathcliff. </p>
<p> Repeated Use of Motifs </p>
<p> Many examples of gothic literature contain similar motifs, or devices that convey a thematic impact. The motif of the doppelganger, characters that reflect the duality of human nature, appears notably in Stevenson’s "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde." The dream motif, in which dream sequences can convey the subconscious, also features in gothic literature. “Frankenstein” contains a notable example in Victor’s dream of his lover, Elizabeth. </p>
<p> Symbolism </p>
<p> Since its first appearance in the late 18th century, gothic literature made heavy use of symbolism to explore themes of human experience. Often, the supernatural elements, such as the veiled and bloody nun in Matthew Lewis’ 1796 “The Monk,” convey the hidden terrors contained in human nature. Oscar Wilde’s “Picture of Dorian Gray,” published a century later, accomplishes this same feat with the symbolism of the namesake painting. </p>

<p> Best Gothic Books Of All Time </p>
<p> Making its debut in the late 18th century, Gothic fiction was a branch of the larger Romantic movement that sought to stimulate strong emotions in the reader - fear and apprehension in this case. Gothic fiction places heavy emphasis on atmosphere, using setting and diction to build suspense and a sense of unease in the reader. Common subject matter includes the supernatural, family curses, mystery, and madness. </p>
<p> When adding books to the list, please make sure "gothic" is listed on the book's main genre page. </p>

<p> I'm afraid I'm not up on the latest authors. And I can't vote for a book or an author I haven't read . . . </p>
<p> But, if we're talking "Greatest Gothic Novel of ALL TIME" one would be a fool to limit oneself only to authors who have published in the last 10 - 25 years. To be truly considered for the crown of "Greatest of All Time," a book must stand toe-to-toe with those known to have stood the test of time: Shelley's Frankenstein; Dracula; some of Edgar Allen Poe's works, to name only a few. </p>
<p> There are a few problems with this list. One is that some of the texts aren't novels, they're short stories, such as "The Yellow Wallpaper", or collections of short stories, such as M.R. James. Then we get to Poe's poetry, which is even further away from a novel! Others are indeed novels, but they're not gothic novels, they're novels which include parodies of gothic, namely "Northanger Abbey" and "Lady Oracle". I'd suggest pruning the list of anything which is very definitely not a novel, to begin with. Novellas such as "Carmilla" are probably OK, but anything ten pages long is nowhere near a novel. </p>
<p> The list is titled "Best Gothic Books of All Time" - this makes our life easy as any type of fiction can be included, no matter whether novella, short story, short story collection or novel. Why should we limit ourselves to novels unnecessarily? I do agree that Northanger Abbey, for example, is a parody of the genre. However, as a parody it still contains all the elements necessary to be classed as a "gothic novel". It therefore should not be excluded from the list. </p>
<p> Elettaria has a case, in that collections of short stories may have diverse subject matter and not all be Gothic in nature; and poetry is rarely "Gothic," since that's mainly a type of fiction. Both points would apply to Poe's collected fiction and poetry; but I still voted for that selection, because it includes so many masterpieces of Gothic literature, such as "The Fall of the House of Usher." I'm inclined to side with Christine's more inclusive approach. </p>
<p> That said, I don't think that "Gothic" is the most accurate description of The Island of Dr. Moreau. Wells was a writer of the Romantic school (in his own time, his novels were called "scientific romances"), and he certainly evoked fear and dread in that novel. IMO, though, it doesn't have a traditionally Gothic setting or subject matter. But maybe I'm just nit-picking! :-) </p>
<p> What about Beloved? Am I completely off base? Why is Beloved considered a gothic novel. Also, doesn't gothic refer to a specific time period? There is some fairly modern literature on this list... </p>
<p> Coconut Library, I haven't read Beloved, so I'll let somebody else comment on that. But as to your question about the time period, the answer, at least as far as the publishing industry and book trade is concerned (I'm a librarian, so I have to keep up with that milieu), is "no." The Gothic school of fiction originated in the late 1700s; but literature written later --even books being written today-- are still called "Gothic" if they have the same characteristics. </p>

<p> I demand more Shirley Jackson. She is right up there with Poe himself. The Sundial please. </p>
<p> Actually, Seth, it isn't only the person who created this list (whoever he/she is) who can add books to it --you, and the rest of us, can too. So, you can consider yourself duly authorized to see that Ms. Jackson gets the representation here that she deserves. (I haven't read The Sundial myself, but I sure voted for The Haunting of Hill House!) </p>
<p> I think the best darkest and most Gothic tale was Bram Stoker's Dracula. Vlad was truly evil in every sense and even love wasn't strong enough to smother the demon inside him. </p>
<p> Cool list, this provides me with lots of ideas for new books to read! </p>
<p> One thing... As much as I love Germinal - I wouldn't consider it Gothic in any way. If I'd want to put a label on it, I would rather say it's realist, naturalist or socialist. </p>
<p> Hi guys, bit of a loose end now. I am trying desperately to think of some ideas for an extended essay on Gothic Novels. I was thinking along the lines of gender differences for authors or within the novels themselves. Any of you lovely people fancy giving me any more ideas? Get in contact with me however you like! Much appreciated! </p>
<p> Beloved often gets read in relation to the Gothic by lit scholars, and does feature a lot of tropes usually found in Gothic lit (like ghosts). Clarissa, on the other hand, is not Gothic at all. I would love to hear why the five people who voted for it feel that it belongs on this list. </p>
<p> I think that the graphic novel of "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" should be replaced with the actual book, "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" by Washington Irving... I suspect a lot of people voted for this thinking it was the original book (I know I almost did) </p>
<p> I think you should also include Patrick McGrath's "Grotesque" and "Dr.Haggard's Disease". </p>
<p> Anitha, you can add those yourself! Just click on the "add books" link near the top, and then use the search function to bring up the titles you want to add. </p>
<p> Noel, I haven't read Solaris (so, of course, I'm not the person who added it here!). But I have read a friend's review of it, and I'd have to say that while it's not traditionally Gothic, the plot and premise DO make use of some basic Gothic tropes. The lonely, isolated research station with its handful of humans functions as a sort of haunted house, and the protagonist sees hallucinations (or are they hallucinations?) of a dead love interest while he grapples with an ominous-seeming mystery. I could see how whoever put it on this list could reasonably argue that it's appropriate. </p>
<p> Pleas add The Turn of the Screw by Henry James. I hope someday my novel Mara, Book One of The Roses of the Moon will make this list! </p>
<p> Also The Bloody Chamber and Magic Toy Shop by Angela Carter also ed as Blood by Tanith Lee and her Secret Books of Paradys. Must be on here! :) </p>
<p> Alyne, The Turn of the Screw is already on this list (it's number 41). You can add the ones by Carter and Lee yourself. And best wishes for success with Mara! </p>
<p> great list....much appreciated! great way to find books in the genre i'm interested in....found some great creepy horrors on this list also. </p>
<p> Nice list but I'm pretty sure Lovecraft and his fellow Weird authors are fairly far removed from the Gothic definition. Granted Otranto has the mysterious limb of the Galactus-sized Giant in the hall so perhaps I'm wrong in this belief. </p>
<p> Does "gothic" refer to writing from a certain era or about a certain era or is it only the stylistic elements described above? Can a story that takes place in the present time be considered gothic?? thanks! </p>
<p> Rhiannon wrote: "Aren't some of these more... historical horror than gothic?" I'd like to know too. </p>
<p> As I understand it, the term Gothic refers to a particular literary style/subgenre. So yes, a book that exhibits those kinds of characteristics is Gothic, regardless of when it's written. </p>
<p> MomToKippy wrote: "Does "gothic" refer to writing from a certain era or about a certain era or is it only the stylistic elements described above? Can a story that takes place in the present time be considered gothic..." </p>
<p> It's mostly about the elements no matter when or where the story takes place. There is also Gothic Horror as sub genre. </p>
<p> I voted for Bram Stoker's Dracula because I believe it holds the top spot of gothic masterpieces. The first book that actually made me feel multiple emotions on every single page it hung onto every word. I still can't stop talking about how much I loved this book. Dracula is the book I be seen reading on my death bed. </p>
<p> Gothic isn't gothic without a castle, monastery, convent, some living architecture with its own secrets. Haunting of Hill House is the best example. http://flickeringlamps.com/2015/04/03... Go here to see Walpole's house. </p>
<p> The Shadow of the Wind, which I've read, is not listed as Gothic genre on it's Goodreads listing page, and I don't see it as belonging, it's more of a creepy mystery. </p>
<p> Inheritance by Tom Savage. I don't know if it completely fits the genre, but it's as close as I have found in recent books. Excellent book, anyway, regardless, but to me it was gothic. </p>
<p> Gothic fiction, which is largely known by the subgenre of Gothic horror, is a genre or mode of literature and film that combines fiction and horror, death, and at times romance or happiness. Its origin is attributed to English author Horace Walpole, with his 1764 novel The Castle of Otranto, subtitled (in its second edition) "A Gothic Story". Wikipedia </p>
<p> I'm not quite sure why The Catcher In The Rye is on this. It has been a while since I read it, but I don't recall anything especially gothic about it. </p>
<p> The rockabilly werewolf from Mars wrote: "I'm not quite sure why The Catcher In The Rye is on this. It has been a while since I read it, but I don't recall anything especially gothic about it." </p>
<p> My guess is that putting it on this list was somebody's idea of a joke. I'm a Goodreads librarian, so I can delete it, if you'll tell me what number it is on the list. (That'll save me some time hunting for it!) </p>
<p> The rockabilly werewolf from Mars wrote: "I'm not quite sure why The Catcher In The Rye is on this. It has been a while since I read it, but I don't recall anything especially gothic about it." </p>
<p> Since this comment was posted, I've discovered that there are LOTS of books on this list that don't have anything especially Gothic about them, not just this one! In the last two days, I've probably deleted at least two dozen improperly added books, and expect to delete a lot more. </p>
<p> "Gothic" might be a hard term for many modern readers to define, but the list description gives you a convenient rule to follow: add only books that list "Gothic" as a genre on the book's main Goodreads page. Not every book set in the historical past, or every book that involves a murder mystery, or even every book with a supernatural premise, is automatically "Gothic!" (And just because an author wrote one Gothic novel doesn't necessarily make everything else that he/she ever wrote automatically "Gothic," either.) </p>
<p> Werner, I appreciate the work you've done on cleaning up the list. It needed it. But it appears that a lot of books that most fans of the genre would consider 'gothic' are no longer there. The most apparent example being Dracula, which was at one time in the forefront on this list. If the main consideration for a book's inclusion is it having the genre listing of Gothic on its book page, is there a way to make such a thing happen? I have considered this list a valuable resource for finding good reads for some time. And will consider it so still. Just not quite so highly as I once did. Thanks for listening (er, reading... :) </p>

<p> Jon, good question! There is; but one person can't do it alone. When you join Goodreads, the program automatically sets your bookshelves up with three basic shelves (read, currently reading, and to read). But many people go on to create customized shelves of their own, sometimes by genre (including "Gothic"). Some very simple, generic shelf names, like Gothic, are used by a LOT of people, even though they don't coordinate with each other. </p>
<p> On the book records, where a list of "Genres" is supplied, the Goodreads program apparently lists every customized shelf name (like "Gothic," "Fiction," "Horror," etc.) that a certain number of people have all shelved the book as. (I don't know how large that number has to be.) The more people who have a "Gothic" shelf (I don't myself) and list a particular book on it, the more likely it is that Goodreads will list "Gothic" as one of the book's genres. </p>
<p> "Gothic" can be a relatively subjective term, not as cut-and-dried and easy to define as some even for people who know literature; and many other people are relatively clueless about what it is (as some of their list additions demonstrate!) I don't know the list creator, Rachel; but I'm guessing she set up that criteria as a way of bringing in an objective yardstick, and replacing idiosyncratic individual judgement with the collective perspective of many readers (in the hope that the latter would be more likely to be accurate). </p>
<p> All of that said, I can see Gothic elements in Dracula, though I personally usually associate "Gothic" with something set strictly in or around one particular sinister building. If you want to re-add it, I won't delete it again, even if it's not on the requisite number of people's "Gothic" shelves. :-) </p>
<p> Just by way of update, Dracula is on the list as #158. It doesn't look like a recent re-addition, so I'm guessing it wasn't deleted after all. </p>

<p> With fall finally upon us, there’s no better time to curl up with something slightly spooky and a little romantic. When the weather begins to cool down, you can’t ask for a better book to curl up with than a good gothic novel. Now is the time for the subtly supernatural and the hauntingly ominous stories, and we’ve got tons for you to get started with. </p>
<p> Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea, by April Genevieve Tucholke The real beauty in a good gothic story is the irresistible mixture of seductive horror and twisted romance, and Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea checks those boxes, along with several others. Weird old-moneyed mansion? Check. Seaside setting? All-but-orphaned protagonist? Charismatic and probably dangerous new guy in town? Check, check, and check. Hauntings, eerie happenings, uncovered secrets, and death? Checkmate. </p>
<p> Compulsion, by Martina Boone There’s something particularly sweet and satisfying about a Southern gothic tale, which is exactly what Boone’s cooked up in her Heirs of Watson Island series. Understandably, there’s a prevailing sense of the grotesque as Barrie Watson is shuttled off to her aunt’s South Carolina plantation after her mother’s death. Getting to the bottom of her family’s cursed legacy is critical for Barrie, as she’s surrounded on all sides by supernatural forces out to get her. </p>
<p> The Madman’s Daughter, by Megan Shepherd There’s a reason the gothic genre has stuck around: so many of its novels are timeless. So, it’s always a delight when new authors reinterpret the canon texts. That’s what The Madman’s Daughter does with H.G. Wells’ classic The Island of Doctor Moreau. Here, the star is 16-year-old Juliet, the doctor’s daughter. After the events of that novel, Juliet has worked to make a life for herself, outside the shadow of her family’s past—until she discovers her father is alive and continuing his grisly experiments. </p>
<p> The Raven Boys, by Maggie Stiefvater Unless you’ve been living under a haunted rock, you’ve probably heard of the wildly successful Raven Cycle series. We’ll just take this opportunity to reiterate how breathtaking it is and how there are not nearly enough ancient Welsh kings buried in Virginia or ley-lines or teenage psychics in modern fiction these days. Oh, just go read it already. </p>
<p> The Girl From the Well, by Rin Chupeco Just like Chupeco’s other standout novel, The Bone Witch, there’s a lot about death here to explore, and The Girl From the Well walks close to the line of straight Stephen King-like horror when doing so. But ultimately, this is a story about ghosts and how they both protect and haunt the living, prime gothic territory. Okiku was 16 when she was murdered. She’s spent the ensuing hundreds of years killing the murderers of children. Now, she’s fascinated by a boy with strange tattoos—and the malevolent presence that follows him. </p>
<p> This Monstrous Thing, by Mackenzi Lee Frankenstein is the exemplar of all the brooding and moodiness that marks the gothic genre. In This Monstrous Thing, Mary Shelley’s classic story finds itself mixed up in a steampunk-y mystery. It’s Geneva, 1818, and mechanical clockwork is a new technology, one met with stigma and superstition. In this world, young Alasdair has done the unthinkable in resurrecting his brother, an act seemingly captured in a book about a man and a monster. </p>
<p> In the Shadow of Blackbirds, by Cat Winters The world in 1918 felt like a world on the edge. As World War I raged, the Spanish influenza ravaged the streets of the United States. This is the setting for In the Shadow of Blackbirds and for the aptly named 16-year-old Mary Shelley Black, who’s plunged by the most vibrant of accidents into an occultist world of séances and spiritualism. The nature of her discoveries makes for an intensely intriguing love story that crosses into the beyond. </p>
<p> Far Far Away, by Tom McNeal There are lots of stories with characters who hear voices. There are fewer stories with characters who hear the voices of storytellers. Jeremy Johnson Johnson (yes, you read it right), however, is one such character, and in his head, he hears the ghost of Jacob Grimm, of The Brothers Grimm. The resulting book reads like one of Grimm’s fairy tales, part enchantment and part bone-chilling terror, with Jeremy along for the dangerous ride. </p>
<p> Through the Woods, by Emily Carroll Are you in the market for an endlessly unsettling graphic novel? Great! Five chillingly illustrated stories take you on a journey of murder and of ghosts, of séances and of dreams—and of course those dark and dangerous woods. It’ll give you all the same feels you once had with Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, only now you’re much more mature and less likely to sleep with the light on, of course. </p>
<p> The Name of the Star, by Maureen Johnson The Shades of London series manages something special: bringing the Southern gothic to stalk the well-worn streets of London. Rory Deveaux leaves Louisiana behind for a boarding school in not-so-jolly England. Besides the run-of-the-mill new-kid struggles, Rory’s just stepped in to something more horrific: a series of copycat murders similar to Jack the Ripper’s killing spree. Also, London has a secret ghost-police force. </p>
<p> Beware the Wild, by Natalie C. Parker You should pick this one up primarily because of two words: haunted swamp. Nothing good happens in the swamp outside of Sticks, Louisiana. Sterling knows this, and after her brother, Phin, goes missing in its muddy depths, she may be the only one who can figure out what happened. Phin didn’t return, but a girl named Lenora May comes home in his place—and Sterling’s the only one who remembers she had a brother, not a sister. It’s a Southern twist on changeling mythology. </p>
<p> The Dark Between, by Sonia Gensler There’s a pleasure in suspense, particularly when that suspense is built in a world where the supernatural and the charlatan combine. Kate, Elsie, and Asher have all wound up at Summerfield College, all on the run from something unpleasant in their past. But the future doesn’t look much better: Their temporary peace is punctuated by mysterious deaths on campus. The old-fashioned Victorian mystery is fueled by the unknown: whether the deaths are the work of this world or the next. </p>
<p> Servants of the Storm, by Delilah S. Dawson Hurricane Josephine destroyed Savannah, Georgia, and took the life of Dovey’s best friend, Carly. Dovey’s spent most of the year since medicated, numbed to the world around her—until she sees Carly in a coffee shop. Dovey ditches her pills, and as she starts to see things clearly, those things get freakier by the minute. That hurricane? It doesn’t seem like the work of natural forces at all, dear reader. </p>
<p> Sweet Unrest, by Lisa Maxwell It’s a steamy Louisiana summer in this story that flows swiftly and strangely between the waking and dream worlds. Lucy thinks she’s going to have a boring summer with her family in New Orleans until she’s plagued by dark, intense dreams. Black magic and voodoo mark Lucy’s quest to get to the bottom of her nightly journeys into a nightmarish past. A little forbidden romance doesn’t hurt the mixture. </p>

<p> What Are the Conventions of the Gothic Horror Genre? </p>
<p> Gothic fiction, which reached the height of its popularity in the late 18th to mid-19th centuries, was a genre of fiction that focused on the darker, irrational and more terrifying aspects of life. The Gothic novel was a reaction against the Enlightenment, which saw the world and humans as ordered and logical. Gothic conventions have remained popular and are still found in novels, music and film. </p>
<p> Conventions of Setting </p>
<p> “Gothic” derives from a style of medieval architecture, and Gothic fiction is often set in medieval castles or churches. These settings are often dark, gloomy and full of secret chambers, hallways and dungeons. Wild, dark and dangerous locations, such as abandoned graveyards, forests and other untamed places, are also common. In more contemporary Gothic literature, such as Henry James’s “Turn of the Screw,” older houses and manors replaced castles, though the sense of mystery and gloominess remained a strong element. </p>
<p> Conventions of Characters </p>
<p> The Gothic hero is often an isolated or “marked” figure who must restore himself to society. A figure of evil -- sometimes with a relationship to the supernatural -- is often in opposition to the hero. Women play significant roles in Gothic novels; they are often depicted as victims of tyrannical and evil men. Doppelgangers -- “doubles” that are similar in appearance, history and character to main characters in the novel -- are common in Gothic novels. </p>
<p> Conventions of Plot </p>
<p> Gothic plots often surround a family mystery, ancient prophecies or revenge. Concepts of “inherited” curses or terrible family mysteries are common; often, the protagonist must overcome an ancestral curse to restore the world to order. The Gothic novel sometimes depicts a fallen society -- one that has succumbed to some kind of evil or temptation -- that must brought back to the light. </p>
<p> Other Conventions </p>
<p> Most Gothic novels contain themes of ghosts, monsters or the supernatural. Although these elements are fantastic, Gothic novels sometimes report the events in an empirical manner, creating a tension between the scientific and the supernatural. Gothic fiction often contains grotesque or “unnatural” events, such as murder, suicide, madness and torture. In addition, many Gothic novels use the “Gothic Counterfeit” theme, in which a story is told by claiming that it is a found text, a diary entry or a series of letters. The Gothic Counterfeit gives an illusion of authenticity, heightening the drama and horror of the events recounted by the author. This storytelling device is used in “The Castle of Otranto,” an early Gothic novel, as well as “Dracula,” which uses the epistolary method, or a story told through letters. </p>

<p> The Creation And Evolution Of The Gothic Grotesque </p>
<p> For over two centuries, Gothic literature has been exploring these questions. As a genre, Gothic investigates the darker side of human nature, evolves in response to contemporary anxieties, and often raises controversy along the way. Writers who employ the Gothic characterize everyday conflicts in grotesque fantasies and acknowledge that we are not free: of social roles, death, or even ourselves. </p>
<p> The Gothic mode in a very general sense has always existed. Since humanity’s earliest days, it seems that darkness is an undeniable fact of our nature. Readers can find Gothic elements in the story of Cain and Abel, Beowulf, the ‘Danse Macabre,’ and the dark folklore of vampires and spirits from various cultures throughout the ages. However, Gothic as a genre has a formal history in literature. The term originally derived from Germanic tribes, the Goths, who played a key role “in the fall of the Roman Empire.” Little factual records of them remains, but they are historically associated with intense, barbarian, primitive ways. It is not their actual history that is so significant but the cultural myths that they inspired. According to Punter and Byron, “‘Gothic’ became a highly mobile term, remaining constant only in the way it functioned to establish a set of polarities revolving primarily around the concepts of the primitive and the civilized.” During the Renaissance era, Gothic referred to the ornate, extreme architecture of the late Middle Ages, particularly evident in cathedrals. This soaring architecture of pointed arches, pinnacles, and flying buttresses was meant to inspire awe, thoughts of the afterlife, the divine, and even apocalyptic fear in those who saw it. A prominent example would be the extreme height, massiveness, severe, sharp angles, and intricate decoration of such Gothic cathedrals as France’s Reims or Rouen. Frightening, monstrous creations such as gargoyles and apocalyptic bas-relief sculptures in niches were hallmarks of this style, and their grotesque but captivating nature mirrors the nature of the Gothic as well. </p>
<p> Aesthetically, this style was directly opposed to the more restrained Greco-Roman and later Neoclassical styles, which relied upon rational order, naturalism, and simpler lines. This contrast also holds true for Neoclassical and Gothic literature. Gothic literature was originally conceived in the eighteenth-century as a reaction to the prevailing thought of the “Age of Enlightenment” of the seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries. The premise of Enlightenment thought and literature relies upon humanity’s capacity of reason to bring order, light, and improvement to the world (“Enlightenment”). Because of its Greco-Roman influences on thought and taste, it was also known as the Neoclassical era, which spanned over a century, from 1660-1798. The Romantic rebelled against those ideas and focused on the individual and lone self, imagination, and emotion. While Romanticism was “the product of a sensibility that glorifies the self in isolation from society, the Gothic explores the darker side of the Romantic vision,” writes Karen F. Stein. Gothic also drew from the distant past, specifically the medieval times of Gothic architecture. Horatio Walpole’s novel ‘The Castle of Otranto’ (1764), actually subtitled ‘A Gothic Romance,’ has deliberately sinister elements and a haunted castle as the main setting. It is generally considered the “founding text of Gothic fiction” that set the standard for the genre. </p>
<p> The legacy of the Goths is “pagan vigour, profusion, and embellishment” which Gothic authors embrace in their writing as an alternative to “staid” neoclassical paradigms. Gothic literature was critically dismissed in the neoclassical era as “crude, barbaric, unfettered, disorderly, and licentious.” While rationalist thought sought to quarantine them, the Gothic genre tackled and vividly explored these undesirable sides of human nature. The Gothic literature demonstrates that the chaos and darkness of the world cannot be ordered, contained, nor denied, and even that our very reason is not always used for the best purposes if it is used at all. While the Enlightenment worldview sees potential in improving our world, the Gothic world is already doomed. </p>
<p> Writers of the Gothic genre use their own unique vocabulary to create a dark, disturbing world with an ornate and unfettered nature that exudes dynamic energy. From the mysterious world of its medieval origins springs forth the evocative possibilities of strangeness, chaos and passion. The Gothic world is one of mystery, magic, tension, illusion, fear, sometimes even perversity. Authors do not avoid death and decay; their crumbling, antiquated settings are central to the eerie events that unfold in their fiction. </p>
<p> As the Gothic genre gained momentum in Europe following the late eighteenth-century publication of Horatio Walpole’s ‘Castle of Otranto,’ it became significant in American literature also. Since the first major efforts in American literature coincided the era of the European Gothic, “American fiction began in the Gothic mode.” An early example of this is the Gothic eighteenth-century novel ‘Wieland’ (1798) by Charles Brockden Brown. By the mid-nineteenth century, the work of Edgar Allan Poe possessed distinct and masterful Gothic form. However, the new world of America had a different context than Europe. Instead of remnants of feudal times such as castles and abbeys, there was entirely new unknown and uncharted territory. “How uncanny, how mysterious, how unknowable and infinitely beyond their control must have seemed the vast wilderness of the New World, to the seventeenth–century Puritan settlers!” writes Joyce Carol Oates of the inception of American Gothic. As America grew as a nation and its wilderness was cultivated and civilization established in its place, its older homes, especially its mansions, became the new “castles.” Later in the modern era, the contemporary Gothic used the most subtle and ordinary of settings to reveal fearful elements implicit in our lives. </p>
<p> In order to inspire fear, terror, or horror, Gothic writers employ a variety of themes. Common plots often include imprisonment, entrapment, pursuit, violence, and escape. Evil characters include male villains, and their counterparts, femme fatales. Protagonists range from female victims, naifs, and outside narrators. </p>
<p> Ghosts, doppelgangers, and sometimes vampires, witches, or monsters are fantastic and symbolic characters. Perceptions can include paranoia, feelings of persecution, unsettled psyches or even madness. There are flourishes of the grotesque, the uncanny, and exploration of taboos. </p>
<p> Physical space is not the sole source of confinement in Gothic literature. It could be mental or emotional as well. As the modern science of psychology originated in the Victorian era, Gothic possessed more sophisticated possibilities. Such focus on the mind demonstrates that the reader does not have to go so far to be in the realm of the Gothic. The greater turmoil or confinement could occur in a character’s mind. A haunted house is a standard icon of Gothic literature. So too is a haunted mind, one troubled or even mad. Sometimes both elements intersect, and it can be very hard to discern the reality of the situation. The enigmatic nature of the Gothic often lies in its power to provoke mystery by unsettling our accepted notions of reality. Illusion is a “core motif” of Gothic fiction that serves to illustrate human frailties, especially those of perception. </p>
<p> The Gothic genre is highly “malleable” and varied, often difficult to pinpoint in immutable terms. While a work such as ‘The Castle of Otranto’ or Abraham Stoker’s ‘Dracula’ could easily be considered distinctly Gothic, the modern forms of Gothicism has evolved into broader and subtler varieties. Each era brings with it a new set of anxieties that find their way into Gothicism. The deeper significance of the Gothic is the creative possibilities for the writer in the stage it sets: it gives language to the unspeakable. Thus, the Gothic can be an excellent vehicle for the most challenging of subtexts. Concerning the sweeping variety of Gothic that exists today, Gothic is more suitably considered a vision rather than solely a genre; there is “richness and magnitude of the gothic-grotesque vision and the inadequacy of genre labels if by genre is meant mere formula,” writes Joyce Carol Oates. </p>

<p> Elements of gothic literature </p>
<p> Hello to all the readers, how are you? I hope everything is going great in your life and you all are working hard towards success. So I am back again with a topic which will help you in more than one way. This blog is going to help those who are enrolled in the literature course. This time I have selected a topic in relation to gothic literature. Today’s topic is Elements of Gothic literature. We all have to agree with the fact that Literature is a subject that fascinates most of the students. You get the power of criticism and research. </p>
<p> The purpose of writing this blog is to enlighten all those who are facing issues with this topic or those who want to read more on this. I have done a lot of research on gothic literature and after that prepared this blog. In this blog, you will find answers of all the intricate areas related to Gothicism. This blog also provides assignment help to those students who are on the verge of starting an assignment work. </p>
<p> So before beginning this blog let’s have a look at all the points I have covered in this: </p>
<p> History of Gothic literature </p>
<p> What Is Gothic Literature? </p>
<p> Elements of Gothic Literature </p>
<p> Characteristics of the Gothic Villain or Antagonist </p>
<p> What Is American Southern Gothic Literature? </p>
<p> Elements of Gothic Literature of southern part </p>
<p> List of few well known Gothic novels </p>
<p> Where it all started? </p>
<p> Not hard to define. Gothic literature arose in the last 18th to early 19th century, mainly in England. Soon in the US as well. It tells stories which are mystic, suspense and supernatural. Among its horror and terror elements, it’s still romantic because of its Romanticism roots. Obviously, it aims to explore a darker and more tragic theme than the Romantic works of that period. </p>
<p> During the first few years when Gothic literature just appeared, the writers followed a model that the background will always be in an old castle, an abandoned height or somewhere forsaken. Rather than describing the horror directly, they use atmosphere instead. This is exactly how Gothic literature differs from traditional horrific literature. The atmosphere would always be mystic and dread, emotions running high, with a plot of, generally, hidden secrets, ghost, vampire, and miserable life. </p>
<p> Protagonists in Gothic literature often have a strong mind, even being isolated or alone. This isolation can be either mentally (cut off from people around) or physically (trapped in a coffin alive). Another main characteristic of Gothic literature which would be easier to define is the “Damsel in Distress” setting, either this “damsel” being threatened by a man or just the circumstance that they find themselves in. </p>
<p> Supernatural elements also appear quite often in Gothic literature, such as unlucky omen, an ancient curse, dark force, ghost, vampire and unexplained manifestation. As from drama, Gothic literature emphasizes emotion and reflects on a sense of drama, and this could be kidnapping, blackmailing, murdering or people going mad/dying because of their (mental) illness. The rise and decline would also be a plot appearing in Gothic literature, which can be a family, a country, a community or if they prefer an individual. </p>
<p> What Is Gothic Literature? </p>
<p> What is Gothic? Often this question comes in the minds of various students of literature. The answer to this question cannot become in a line or two. Gothic is an art, lifestyle or a certain sensibility. This word ‘Gothic’ can be defined in three different ways. Firstly, you can say gothic as a strange mysterious and adventurous stories set in dark and gloomy places. These places can be ruins of a castle or a church. Secondly, you could understand this as a style of printing or writing in which the alphabets are very ornate. And lastly, a building such as a cathedral that has a style of architecture that is distinguished by all pillars, high vaulted ceiling, and pointed arches. The above mention definitions of gothic literature are also the elements of gothic literature. </p>
<p> Gothic is an architectural term. It indicates the pointed arch which you can see on Churches and Castles. Gothic architecture was widespread in Western Europe between the 12th and 16th centuries. These architectures of Europe play a role in shaping gothic literature setting. In the world of literature, the word Gothic refers to fiction consist of horrifying and supernatural elements. These two elements of gothic literature are responsible for holding the plot together. Gothic literature is an exciting and terrifying mixture of horror and fiction along with a pinch of romance in it. The Gothic literature has a long history. But with Walpole’s Castle of Otranto in 1765, Gothic literature history started to have changed. Certain romantic elements of Gothic literature are the result of these changes. </p>
<p> Elements of Gothic Literature in West </p>
<p> Terror and wonder excite us all. We all are afraid of ghosts and monsters but still like to read about them. This inspired the gothic writers to write more. There are some elements of gothic literature which you can find in all the novels of this genre. If you are a university student and looking for online assignment help , then probably you should look at these elements. You may find vital information on these points. </p>
<p> Dark, Abandoned, Decaying Settings </p>
<p> “Gothic” also implies a style of ornate, and grand France architecture in the 12th century. When we talk about the elements of gothic literature, the first thing we can notice is the houses, Cobwebbed castles, derelict churches, secret passageways, hidden skeletons, dead bodies claustrophobic interiors with hidden doors and death of a character. The setting of the outside world also kept dark themed. Weather remains wrathful, thunder striking all the time. We can also see a malevolent forest inside it a ghostly graveyard and wilderness. </p>
<p> Romanticized Past </p>
<p> The second element of Gothic literature is a romanticized setting. You can always see that major characters are in love with each other and family is against their love due to a disputed past. The best example of this, you can see in the novel The Bride of Lammermoor by Walter Scott. </p>
<p> Plot conventions </p>
<p> The third explicit element of common Gothic plots includes revenge, prophecies, familial secrets, and curses. You can notice that the ghost of pasts still haunts the present character. It has breathing, living and controlling the lives of other people. Beloved by Toni Morrison is the greatest example where past haunts the present. Ghost of the Beloved, Sethe’s third child, haunts them. </p>
<p> Horror and fear </p>
<p> Horror and fear are the most important elements of the gothic literature. Novels of this genre bring the feeling of intense fear, dread, and disgust in the reader. </p>
<p> Supernatural Beings </p>
<p> When you read any Gothic literature work, you will come face to face with supernatural beings. Monsters, demons, witches, ghosts, banshees, vampires, and other supernatural creatures often play parts in Gothic fiction. </p>
<p> Explorations of Romance and Sexuality. </p>
<p> During uptight Victorian times, Gothic literature allowed readers and authors to explore the areas of romance and sexuality. Transgressive thoughts, impulses, and desires were there but in a fairly heteronormative way. Sexuality in Gothic literature is in repressed form. Women are expected to be submissive and helpless. Women were expected to be chaste, and men are predatory. Society was patriarchal, men considered as superior, and every action made by them needs to be followed by women. </p>
<p> Anti-Heroes </p>
<p> Gothic literature hero is portrayed as a flawed character. He is an isolated, outcast and lonesome figure. The protagonist has to make efforts to overcome the obstacles to make an image in society. </p>
<p> Heavy Reliance on Symbolism </p>
<p> Symbols play an important role in Gothic literature. Character, object, and settings all have symbolic meaning. Wild forest, Dark weather, Thunderstorm, Ruined Castle all have meanings attached to them. </p>
<p> Common Devices, Themes, and Motifs </p>
<p> Haunting, insanity, Curses, prophecies, damsels in distress, women as victims, psychological flips and twists, doppelgangers, fallen societies. </p>
<p> Melodrama </p>
<p> Emotions are on a high side in Gothic literature. The work of heightened emotion is to reflect a high sense of drama. Women have a tendency to lose consciousness and men show anger due to unseen inner torments. You can also see lots of murders, mad people and kidnappings. Villain showed as a powerful character but in the end good wins over bad. </p>
<p> These are the prominent elements of Gothic literature. Take any Gothic novel, and you would find story revolving around these elements. </p>
<p> What is Southern Gothic Literature? </p>
<p> Southern Gothic is a subdivision of American gothic fiction. It set in the South that uses ironic and gruesome characters and ghastly scenes. These settings show the south’s beliefs and values. The aim of the establishment of Gothic literature is to show the social and cultural issues of the south. Elements of Gothic literature of south are more political than American gothic literature. </p>
<p> Elements of Gothic Literature of southern part </p>
<p> In this blog above I have discussed the elements of gothic literature in the west. Now, you will read about the elements of gothic literature in southern America. You will find a great difference in the novels. The stories are mostly black people and related to slavery. They have written about the obstacles and hard times they have had in the past. They discussed their hardships and culture in it. So read further and get the idea about how Gothic literature evolved in the south. </p>
<p> Deep South and Decay </p>
<p> Southern gothic is set in the background of deep South America. Writers also belong from a south part only. This brings authenticity to the settings and writing. It shows a set with a sense of decay, in the deep south of America and the writers of it, are from the south, bringing an authenticity to the setting, which comes with a sense of decay, a pretense of respectability, faded elegance. Gothic literature of the south brings the slave history of blacks. In almost every southern gothic novel you can see physical and moral decay. These two things are the most important elements of gothic literature of southern America. </p>
<p> Black Folks </p>
<p> We have seen that elements of gothic literature in western novels don’t include black folks. The heroines of European gothic and American gothic have white skin, and the spirits that haunt them are often Christian. You will never see any ghost from an African background. </p>
<p> But when we talk about southern gothic, black folks are the central character of the story. The black characters are the identity of the southern American. Southern America is completely portraying the black tradition. From food to music it has everything related to the black audience. </p>
<p> Voodoo and Spirituality </p>
<p> When the African slaves migrated in southern America, they came with their own religion. They started preaching their own practices of voodoo and beliefs. Gothic literature of the south is mainly based on New Orleans. </p>
<p> Above mentioned elements of gothic literature of southern America are the notable ones. Now below I have mentioned a few examples of southern gothic literature. </p>
<p> Characteristics of the Gothic Villain or Antagonist </p>
<p> The Villain Is Dark and Alluring </p>
<p> The Gothic villain is almost all the time is a male character. You will find it strange, but he is also extremely handsome, intelligent, successful, and talented. Also, Gothic villains often showcase as innocents or victims of tough times. (Think Lord Dracula, Dorian Gray, and Heath cliff). </p>
<p> Anti-Villain </p>
<p> As I told you that hero is a flawed character in gothic literature. But the villain has attractive qualities. Gothic literature revolves around good and evil and keeps reader guessing who is what. Sometimes you will find a good guy in a villainous role, but eventually, you find the good in him. Also, you can see in most of the gothic works that a character becomes evil due to circumstances around him/her. For example, the monster in Frankenstein was not an evil, but situations made him one. And then you will see a villain who will attract you. His complex and conflicting psychology make him interesting. Example of such villains is Byronic hero and Satan. </p>
<p> Hero-Villain </p>
<p> A Gothic villain also has a sympathetic past due to which he has become a bad guy. This type of character often hangs between good and bad. </p>
<p> List of few well known Gothic novels </p>
<p> Anne Rice: The Vampire Chronicles series </p>
<p> Eudora Welty: her novels and short stories </p>
<p> Truman Capote: Other Voices, Other Rooms </p>
<p> Edgar Allan Poe: short stories like “Fall of the House of Usher.” </p>
<p> Shirley Jackson: We Have Always Lived in the Castle </p>
<p> Jane Austen: Northanger Abbey </p>
<p> Henry James: The Turn of the Screw </p>
<p> H.P. Lovecraft: The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories </p>
<p> Facing a hard time in understanding Gothic literature? </p>
<p> Do you feel Gothic literature a tough genre in your course? Do you feel difficulty in comprehending any novel and making assignment? Then it’s a time too for online writers for a better understanding of the Gothic literature. Being a literature student is a feeling of pride, but often students fail to score well in exams. </p>
<p> This is because of two reasons. Students either not prepared or busy in making assignments. They spend most of the time in writing and writing only. They forgot that they need understanding also. And when the result of that assignment work comes, they fail to score. Reason being writing an assignment is of no use. You must have skills to write an exceptional assignment. In my opinion, you should look out for online assignment help. If you feel that you don’t have skills or time, then you should take it. When you take the readymade assignment, you will get work done by the expert writers. Your scores will eventually rise up. And secondly, you can focus more on exams. So it’s a win-win situation for you. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> I hope my efforts in writing on this topic will bring good to all my readers. So let’s have a recall of things we have discussed in this blog. Firstly, I gave the briefing of gothic literature. Here you will get the gist of Gothic literature. Secondly, I moved on to the definition of gothic literature. This part consists of time period and reason of the beginning of Gothic genre along with the definition. Then, I focused on the elements of gothic literature in the West. All the elements explained are portrayed in the western American literature. After that, you will see elements of gothic literature in Southern America. Moving towards the end, I have discussed characteristics of a gothic villain. I ended the topic with a list of few novels of gothic literature that are widely famous. </p>

<p> Elements of the Gothic Genre </p>
<p> GOTHIC LITERATURE The gothic novel was invented almost single-handedly by Horace Walpole, whose The Castle of Otranto (1764) contains essentially all the elements that constitute the genre. Walpole's novel was imitated not only in the eighteenth century and not only in the novel form, but it has influenced writing, poetry, and even film making up to the present day. It introduced the term "gothic romance" to the literary world. Due to its inherently supernatural, surreal and sublime elements, it has maintained a dark and mysterious appeal. However, the roots of the Gothic‛ precede the Gothic‛ works of Horace Walpole. The focus on the grotesque in the medieval period (visible especially in the paintings and architecture of the period) provides a key backdrop against which Gothic must be read, as do the violent and often grotesque tragedies written for the Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre, with their detailed, almost surgical exploration of the supernatural, vice, corruption, imprisonment, brutality and sexuality, all of which were to provide the very substance of the Gothic authors. (Note particularly ‘Macbeth‛ and ‘Dr Faustus‛) Gothic literature is devoted primarily to stories of horror, the fantastic, and the “darker” supernatural forces. These forces often represent the “dark side” of human nature— irrational or destructive desires. Gothic literature derives its name from its similarities to the Gothic medieval cathedrals, which feature a majestic, unrestrained architectural style with often savage or grotesque ornamentation (the word “Gothic” derives from “Goth,” the name of one of the barbaric Germanic tribes that invaded the Roman Empire). The Gothic genre (in both literature and architecture) is therefore associated with savagery and barbarism. Generally speaking, gothic literature delves into the macabre nature of humanity in its quest to satisfy mankind's intrinsic desire to plumb the depths of terror. The key features of gothic texts are: 1) the appearance of the supernatural, 2) the psychology of horror and/or terror, 3) the poetics of the sublime, 4) a sense of mystery and dread 5) the appealing hero/villain, 6) the distressed heroine, and 7) strong moral closure (usually at least). ELEMENTS OF THE GOTHIC IN TEXTS 1. Setting in a castle or haunted house. The action takes place in and around an old castle, sometimes seemingly abandoned, sometimes occupied. The castle often contains secret passages, trap doors, secret rooms, dark or hidden staircases, and possibly ruined sections. The castle may be near or connected to caves, which lend their own haunting flavour with their branchings, claustrophobia, and mystery. (Translated into modern filmmaking, the setting might be in an old house or mansion--or even a new house--where unusual camera angles, sustained close ups during movement, and darkness or shadows create the same sense of claustrophobia and entrapment.) It is usually a dwelling that is inhabited by or visited regularly by a ghost or other supposedly supernatural being. Example: Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. Walpole's novel first introduced to gothic literature its single most influential convention, the haunted castle. The castle is the main setting of the story and the centre of activity. Cemetery /Graveyard. A cemetery defines a place which is used for the burial of the dead. Cemeteries are widely used in Gothic Literature as oftentimes frightening places where revenance can occur. Catacombs are especially evocative Gothic spaces because they enable the living to enter below ground a dark labyrinth resonating with the presences and mysteries of the dead. 2. The Weather is used in a number of ways and forms, some of these being: Mist - This convention in Gothic Literature is often used to obscure objects (this can be related to the sublime) by reducing visibility or to prelude the insertion of a terrifying person or thing; Storms - These frequently accompany important events.... </p>

<p> ...﻿Conventions of Gothic here are a number of techniques, devices and conventions common to a great deal of Gothic literature: WEATHER: used in a number of ways and forms, some of these being: Mist - This convention in Gothic Literature is often used to obscure objects (this can be related to the sublime) by reducing visibility or to prelude the insertion of a terrifying person or thing; Storms - These frequently accompany important events. Flashes of lightening accompany revelation; thunder and downpours prefigure the appearance of a character or the beginning of a significant event; Sunlight - represents goodness and pleasure; it also has the power to bestow these upon characters. THE SUBLIME: The definition of this key term has long been a contested term, but the idea of the sublime is essential to an understanding of Gothic poetics and, especially, the attempt to defend or justify the literature of terror. Put basically (and this really is basic - a fuller understanding of the Sublime would be useful to students of Wordsworth or any Gothic Literature), the Sublime is an overpowering sense of the greatness and power of nature, which can be uplifting, awe-inspiring and terrifying, caused by experience of beauty, vastness or grandeur. Sublime moments lead us to consider the place of humanity in the universe, and the power exhibited in the world. We see an example of Gothic... </p>
<p> ...What is Gothic genre? “The idea of a gothic novel was invented almost single-handedly by Horace Walpole, whose ‘The Castle of Otranto’ (1764) contains essentially all the elements that constitute the genre. Walpole's novel has greatly influenced novels not only written from that period of time but also until this date, he has also had great influence upon the short stories, poetry, and even in gothic genre film making up to this present day” Emily Bronte was influence by 'The Bridegroom of Barna', published in the nineteenth century when writing 'Wuthering Heights' The gothic genre consists of many codes and conventions that distinguish it into being gothic like. Often when authors write novels that include Gothicism, they use various techniques to help them build up certain emotions in the readers by using certain themes, motifs and symbols. One of the techniques that are often used in gothic novels is the use of pathetic fallacy. This is when the atmosphere or mood is reflected by the weather. In the case of Gothicism is it often very miserable weather. In the novel of Macbeth for example we are able to see that main type of weather found throughout the play is thunder and lightning storms which occur when evil deeds are carried out. Another example that pathetic fallacy is used within a gothic novel is... </p>
<p> ...“The Raven” by Edgar Allan Poe is a perfect example of the Gothic genre. In fact there may not be a more potent, and certainly not a more famous model of the Gothic Poetry in action. Edgar Allan Poe followed it up with an essay called “The Philosophy of Composition” in which he revealed how he wrote it. Gothic literature is defined as emphasising elements such as grotesqueness, mysteriousness and desolation; generally, it is a marriage between the Horror and Romance genres. The genre shows a dark and mad view of the world through elements such as: The Supernatural (ghosts, spirits etc); madness; isolation and loneliness; death; secrets (such as mysteries or underground passages); monsters (vampires, Frankenstein’s monster etc), and biblical evil (usually in the form of the devil). It takes its name from the style of art and architecture that was used in the Middle Ages which was extravagant and beautiful; but also very gloomy and foreboding (characterised by decorative designs and sculptures including Gargoyles) The Raven certainly fits into this category of The Gothic, and begins with a short description of the speaking character’s isolation and vulnerability. It then tells us very little of the maiden named Lenore whom the character laments (as she is deceased, this may have contributed to the supernatural events later in the poem). The poem... </p>
<p> ...Gothic Elements in the “The Tell Tale Heart” The classic short story of “The Tell-Tale Heart”, written by one of the all time masters of horror, Edgar Allen Poe, has always been used as an excellent example of Gothic fiction. Edgar Allen Poe specialized in the art of gothic writing and wrote many stories that portrayed disturbing events and delved deeply into the minds of its characters. In "The Tell-Tale Heart," Poe revolves the plot around a raving individual who, insisting that he is sane, murders an old man because of his` “vulture eye”. The three main gothic elements that are evident in this story are the unique setting, the theme of death and decay, and the presence of madness. Unlike many other works of gothic fiction, this story does not take place in your typical abandoned monastery, haunted house or ominous castle. The setting is described as a dark and shadowy place (“black as pitch with the thick darkness”), but the story probably takes place in a house located in an urban area instead of an isolated one. We know this because of the neighbors, who are able to hear the old man cry out at night and then proceed to call the police who later show up at the house. Because the house is so vaguely described, the reader is forced to imagine the setting and that makes it all the more frightening. A classic element of gothic fiction typically... </p>
<p> ...Gothic is a literary genre that is connected to the dark and horrific. It became popular in the late Victorian Era, following the success of Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, in 1764. Since that time, gothic literature has become a widespread influence. Some elements that are typically gothic include ancient prophecies, mystery and suspense, supernatural events, dreams and visions, violence, and a gloomy and desolate setting. Charlotte Bronte, the author of Jane Eyre, was greatly influenced by the gothic movement. This is obvious to anyone who has read her work. Jane Eyre, in particular, falls into the tradition of the late eighteenth and nineteenth century gothic novels. Gothic elements can be seen in the mystery behind Thornfield and Rochester's past. There is also a prevalent theme of the supernatural, such as the appearance of Mr. Reed's ghost, the ghoulish and sinister laughter of Bertha Mason, and Rochester's disembodied voice calling out to Jane. Furthermore, there is a great deal of suspense that is generated by the violent behaviour of Bertha Mason. The gothic elements of mystery, violence and the supernatural have the strongest presence in Jane Eyre. The mystery behind Thornfield and Rochester's past is a strong theme in the novel. When Jane first arrived at Thornfield, already she could sense that... </p>
<p> ...﻿Analysis of gothic elements in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and S.T.Coleridge's Christabel Romantic writers commonly used gothic elements to describe supernatural events that included a dark setting and gloomy atmosphere, usually followed by a dreadful crime. Many writers took interest in the gothic, and in this essay I will try to analyze and discuss the use of those elements in Frankenstein written by Mary Shelley and Christabel by S.T.Coleridge. “The Gothic novel could be seen as a description of a fallen world. We experience this fallen world though all aspects of the novel: plot, setting, characterization, and theme.” (De Vore, D.; Domenic, A.; Kwan, A.; Reidy, N.: “The Gothic Novel”)1 The setting is very important in Gothic novels. The novels are usually set in castles, graveyards, dungeons, ruins.. The mood is dark and gloomy, full of horror and suspense. There are also supernatural events and creatures, as well as damsels in distress. The emotions are heightened, there are crimes such as murder or kidnapping. I will start with the analysis of gothic elements in Christabel. “’Tis the middle of night by the castle clock, / And the owls have awakened the crowing cock.” (l. 1-2) These first lines of the poem introduce a macabre setting. We soon learn that the plot is set in the dark woods and the castle. “What... </p>
<p> ...The genre of gothic literature contains both elements of horror and romance, with an innocent female, a powerful male (usually the quintessential villain), as well as themes to do with the supernatural as key features included in the novel. In this chapter, elements of the gothic begin in the very title of the book: the ‘bloody’ in ‘The Bloody Chamber’ associates the idea of death and gore, a more horrific element of the gothic genre; the ‘Chamber’ itself now sounds more claustrophobic and similar to a torture chamber, due to the link to blood. However, blood can be interpreted in different ways throughout the extract, even in a romantic way in this example: ‘the wedding dress…wrapped up in…red ribbon’. Juxtaposing the red of the ribbon with the white of the dress (which symbolises innocence) could represent the staining of virgin blood on a pure dress, or scarring of one’s purity with blood, to represent taking somebody’s identity with them – the person who took her virginity is the one she’ll belong to for the rest of her life. Not only is there a presence of a pure and desirable female (‘the wedding dress he’d bought me’ – hinting at the fact he wants her and he shall buy her this wedding dress and her mother a dress so as to encourage her to marry him), who is dominated by a male (he bought her the dress, instead of letting her choose the design…a... </p>
<p> ...﻿Gothic Elements in the Short Stories of Edgar Allan Poe Edgar Allan Poe is known as the Father of the Gothic. He utilized Gothicism in his short stories such as, ‘The Fall of the House of Usher’ and ‘Ligeia.’ Poe has written numerous literary masterpieces that have focused on the Gothic. Not only have his works been focused on the Gothic, but his life had somewhat of a Gothic theme. Through love, death, and depression, Poe’s life had an impact on the way he wrote, which is evident through in his literary works. Edgar Allan Poe was born on January 19, 1809 to David and Elizabeth Arnold Poe. Poe’s mother Elizabeth died on December 8th after her husband David abandoned the family, Poe was only two years old. Newly orphaned, Poe was taken in by Frances and John Allan. Poe attended a London boarding school in 1818, until the Allans all moved back to Richmond in 1820 (Peeples, xiii). Poe then attended the University of Virginia in 1826, but did not return after Christmas. In 1827, Poe enlisted in the US Army and was stationed at Fort Moultrie in South Carolina. In 1829 he left the army only to return to West Point and re-enroll in 1830. After the death of his wife in 1829, John Allan remarried in 1830 and cut all ties with Poe (Peeples, xiii). In 1831, Poe was expelled from West Point for not going to class or drills. Starting his new, adult life, Poe then moved in with his aunt,... </p>

GOTHIC LITERATURE
The gothic novel was invented almost single-handedly by Horace Walpole, whose The Castle
of Otranto (1764) contains essentially all the elements that constitute the genre.
Walpole's novel was imitated not only in the eighteenth century and not only in the novel
form, but it has influenced writing, poetry, and even film making up to the present day. It
introduced the term "gothic romance" to the literary world. Due to its inherently
supernatural, surreal and sublime elements, it has maintained a dark and mysterious appeal.
However, the roots of the Gothic‛ precede the Gothic‛ works of Horace Walpole. The focus
on the grotesque in the medieval period (visible especially in the paintings and architecture
of the period) provides a key backdrop against which Gothic must be read, as do the violent
and often grotesque tragedies written for the Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre, with
their detailed, almost surgical exploration of the supernatural, vice, corruption,
imprisonment, brutality and sexuality, all of which were to provide the very substance of
the Gothic authors. (Note particularly ‘Macbeth‛ and ‘Dr Faustus‛)
Gothic literature is devoted primarily to stories of horror, the fantastic, and the “darker”
supernatural forces. These forces often represent the “dark side” of human nature—
irrational or destructive desires.
Gothic literature derives its name from its similarities to the Gothic medieval cathedrals,
which feature a majestic, unrestrained architectural style with often savage or grotesque
ornamentation (the word “Gothic” derives from “Goth,” the name of one of the barbaric
Germanic tribes that invaded the Roman Empire). The Gothic genre (in both literature and
architecture) is therefore associated with savagery and barbarism.
Generally speaking, gothic literature delves into the macabre nature of humanity in its
quest to satisfy mankind's intrinsic desire to plumb the depths of terror. The key
features of gothic texts are:
1) the appearance of the supernatural,
2) the psychology of horror and/or terror,
3) the poetics of the sublime,
4) a sense of mystery and dread
5) the appealing hero/villain,
6) the distressed heroine, and
7) strong moral closure (usually at least).

ELEMENTS OF THE GOTHIC IN TEXTS
1. Setting in a castle or haunted house. The action takes place in and around an old
castle, sometimes seemingly abandoned, sometimes occupied. The castle often contains
secret passages, trap doors, secret rooms, dark or hidden staircases, and possibly ruined
sections. The castle may be near or connected to caves, which lend their own haunting
flavour with their branchings, claustrophobia, and mystery. (Translated into modern
filmmaking, the setting might be in an old house or mansion--or even a new house--where
unusual camera angles, sustained close ups during movement, and darkness or shadows
create the same sense of claustrophobia and entrapment.) It is usually a dwelling that is
inhabited by or visited regularly by a ghost or other supposedly supernatural being.
Example: Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. Walpole's novel first introduced to
gothic literature its single most influential convention, the haunted castle. The castle is
the main setting of the story and the centre of activity.
Cemetery /Graveyard. A cemetery defines a place which is used for the burial of the
dead. Cemeteries are widely used in Gothic Literature as oftentimes frightening places
where revenance can occur. Catacombs are especially evocative Gothic spaces because
they enable the living to enter below ground a dark labyrinth resonating with the presences
and mysteries of the dead.
2. The Weather is used in a number of ways and forms, some of these being:
Mist - This convention in Gothic Literature is often used to obscure objects (this
can be related to the sublime) by reducing visibility or to prelude the insertion of a
terrifying person or thing;
Storms - These frequently accompany important events. Flashes of lightning
accompany revelation; thunder and downpours prefigure the appearance of a
character or the beginning of a significant event (eg thunder precedes the entrance
of the witches in ‘Macbeth‛;
Sunlight - represents goodness and pleasure; it also has the power to bestow these
upon characters.
3. An atmosphere of mystery and suspense.(or a sense of dread) The work is pervaded
by a threatening feeling, a fear enhanced by the unknown. Often the plot itself is built
around a mystery, such as unknown parentage, a disappearance, or some other inexplicable
event eg. Ghosts walking or a painting coming to life. There may be an ancient prophecy
connected with the castle or its inhabitants. It is usually obscure, partial or confusing.
This serves to captivate the reader and encourage further reading. The atmosphere
may also be seen acting upon the protagonists in texts, influencing them by exciting their
curiosity or fear.
4. Claustrophobia / Entrapment & Imprisonment:
A favourite horror device of the Gothic finds a person confined or trapped, such as
being shackled to a floor or hidden away in some dark cell or cloister. This sense of
there being no way out contributes to the claustrophobic psychology of Gothic space. It
consists of an abnormal dread of being confined in a close or narrow space. Often

attributed to actual physical imprisonment or entrapment, claustrophobia can also figure
more generally as an indicator of the victim's sense of helplessness or horrified mental
awareness of being enmeshed in some dark, inscrutable destiny
5. The supernatural may be intrinsic to the plot. This is generally in the form of some
kind of supernatural being or object, such as a vampire, witch, devil or ghost, which is
frightening due to its refusal to adhere to the laws of nature, God or man. In ‘Macbeth‛
there are three witches. Dr Faustus communicates with a demon and indirectly with
Lucifer. All of ‘Paradise Lost‛ involves the supernatural.
6. Dreams, omens, portents, visions. Dreaming is characterised as a form of mental
activity that takes place during the act of sleep. Dreams invoke strong emotions within
the dreamer, such as ecstasy, joy and terror. Dreams dredge up these deep emotions
and premonitions that reflect tellingly upon the dreamer, what one might conceal during
waking hours but what emerges in sleep to haunt and arouse the dreamer. It is most
likely due to this heightened emotional state that dreams are used so often within
Gothic Literature. By invoking dream states within their characters, authors are able to
illustrate emotions on a more unmediated and, oftentimes, terrifying level. Dreams
reveal to the reader what the character is often too afraid to realise about himself or
herself. Dreaming also has an ancient relation with the act of foretelling wherein the
future is glimpsed in the dream state. Perhaps the most famous Gothic example of
significant dreams occurs in Shelley's ‘Frankenstein‛ after Frankenstein 'awakes' his
creature: he falls into a dream state that begins with his kissing of Elizabeth, his love.
However, this kiss changes her in the most drastic way as she transforms into the
rotting corpse of Caroline, Victor's dead mother. Upon awakening from this horrifying
dream, Victor finds himself staring into the face of the monster he has created.
Interpretations of this dream lead to explorations of Frankenstein's psyche, relational
ability and sexuality.
A character may have a disturbing dream vision, or some phenomenon may be seen as
a portent of coming events. For example, if the statue of the lord of the manor falls
over, it may portend his death. In modern fiction, a character might see something (a
shadowy figure stabbing another shadowy figure) and think that it was a dream. This
might be thought of as an "imitation vision." Banquo in ‘Macbeth‛ dreams of the ‘weird
sisters‛. Lady Macbeth‛s suppressed guilt emerges when she is seen sleepwalking.

7. The stock characters of Gothic fiction include tyrants, villains, bandits, maniacs,
Byronic heroes, persecuted maidens, femmes fatales, madwomen, magicians, vampires,
werewolves, monsters, demons, angel, fallen angel, the beauty and the beast, revenants,
ghosts, perambulating skeletons, the Wandering Jew, and the Devil himself.

8. Villain-Hero (Satanic, Promethean, Byronic Hero)
The villain of a story who either 1) poses as a hero at the beginning of the story or 2)
simply possesses enough heroic characteristics (charisma, sympathetic past, etc) so that
either the reader or the other characters see the villain-hero as more than a simple
charlatan or bad guy. Three closely related types exist:
Satanic Hero: a Villain-Hero whose nefarious deeds and justifications of
them make him a more interesting character than the rather bland good
hero. Example: The origin of this prototype comes from Romantic misreading
of Milton's Paradise Lost, whose Satan poets like Blake and Shelley
regarded as a far more compelling figure than the moralistic God of Book III
of the epic. Gothic examples: Beckford's Vathek, Radcliffe's Montoni, and
just about any vampire.
Promethean: a Villain-Hero who has done good but only by performing an
over-reaching or rebellious act. Prometheus from ancient Greek mythology
saved mankind but only after stealing fire and ignoring Zeus' order that
mankind should be kept in a state of subjugation. Mary Shelley's
Frankenstein is tellingly subtitled the "Modern Prometheus." Consider
whether Dr Faustus is a Promethean hero. (The vaulting arches and spires of
Gothic cathedrals reach wildly to the sky as if the builders were trying to grasp the
heavens , an ambition for the eternal that is likewise expressed in many works of
Gothic literature (consider Manfred's quest for supernatural power in Byron's poem,
or Frankenstein's quest to become godlike by creating life or Dr.Faustus pact –
offering his soul for 24 years of power).
Byronic Hero: a later variation of the "antithetically mixed" Villain-Hero.
Aristocratic, suave, moody, handsome, solitary, secretive, brilliant, cynical,
sexually intriguing, and nursing a secret wound, he is renowned because of his
fatal attraction for female characters and readers and continues to occasion
debate about gender issues. Example: Byron's Childe Harold and, more
gothically, Manfred are the best examples, but this darkly attractive and
very conflicted male figure surfaces everywhere in the 19th and 20th
century gothic eg Heathcliff or Wilde‛s Dorian Gray. Byron himself was
described as “mad, bad and dangerous to know.”
The Byronic hero in literature and life:
A. Robin Hood
B. Richard III
C. Iago
D. Faust/ Dr.Faustus
E. Milton's Satan
F. Victor Frankenstein
G. Frankenstein's Creature
H. Dracula
I. Byron‛s Manfred
J. Cain

K. Lara
L. Conrad
M. Childe Harold
N. Byron, Shelley
O. Ambrosio
P. Peter Quint
Q. Miss Jessel
R. Stalin
S. Hitler
T. The Unabomber
U. Prometheus

9. The Pursued Protagonist
This refers to the idea of a pursuing force that relentlessly acts in a severely negative
manner on a character. This persecution often implies the notion of some sort of a
curse or other form of terminal and utterly unavoidable damnation, a notion that usually
suggests a return or "hangover" of traditional religious ideology to chastise the
character for some real or imagined wrong against the moral order.
The Wandering Jew is perhaps the archetypically pursued/pursuing protagonist.
--Drew McCray
10. Pursuit of the Heroine
This is the pursuit of a virtuous and idealistic (and usually poetically inclined) young
woman by a villain, normally portrayed as a wicked, older but still potent aristocrat.
While in many early Gothic novels such a chase occurs across a Mediterranean forest
and/or through a subterranean labyrinth, the pursuit of the heroine is by no means
limited to these settings. This pursuit represents a threat to the young lady's ideals and
morals (usually meaning her virginity), to which the heroine responds in the early works
with a passive courage in the face of danger; later gothic heroines progressively become
more active and occasionally effective in their attempts to escape this pursuit and
indict patriarchy. (eg. Angela Carter‛s ‘The Bloody Chamber.‛
Women in distress. As an appeal to the pathos and sympathy of the reader, the female
characters often face events that leave them fainting, terrified, screaming, and/or
sobbing. A lonely, pensive, and oppressed heroine is often the central figure of the novel,
so her sufferings are even more pronounced and the focus of attention. The women suffer
all the more because they are often abandoned, left alone (either on purpose or by
accident), and have no protector at times.
Women threatened by a powerful, impulsive, tyrannical male. One or more male
characters has the power, as king, lord of the manor, father, or guardian, to demand that
one or more of the female characters do something intolerable. The woman may be
commanded to marry someone she does not love (it may even be the powerful male himself),
or commit a crime.

11. The Outsider: The one theme that cuts through virtually all Gothic is that of the
"outsider," embodied in wanderers like Frankenstein's creature. Gothic fiction is concerned
with the outsider, whether the stationary figure who represses his difference, or the
wandering figure who seeks for some kind of salvation, or else the individual who for
whatever reason- moves entirely outside the norm. In any event, he is beyond the
moderating impulses in society, and he must be punished for his transgression.
He is gloomy and melancholy, full of self-pity and self-hatred. Like Cain, he is the perpetual
outsider, marked by his appearance, doomed to wander the four corners of the earth, alone
and reviled. It may be argued that Frankenstein himself becomes an outsider as he grows
more and more like his creation. . While the society at large always appears bourgeois in its
culture and morality, the Gothic outsider is a counterforce driven by strange longings and
destructive needs. While everyone else appears sane, he is insane; while everyone else
appears bound by legalities, he is trying to snap the pitiless constrictions of the law; while
everyone else seems to lack any peculiarities of taste or behaviour, he feels only
estrangement, sick longings, terrible surges of power and devastation. Take for example,
Heathcliff in ‘Wuthering Heights‛.

12. Possession The popularity of belief in demonic possession seems to have originated
within Christian Theology during the Middle Ages. During this time, Christians lived in fear
concerning the war being waged between God and the Devil over every mortal soul. Hence,
this fear of possession seemed to culminate into an act that could be viewed by the mortal
eye. This act is defined as the forced possession of a mortal body by the Devil or one of
his demons. There are two types of possession and either can be voluntary or involuntary.
Voluntary possession seems to involve a willing exchange in the form of some compact
between evil spirit and mortal, often involving wealth, power or goods (eg. The pact Faustus
makes); involuntary possession occurs when the devil randomly selects an unwitting host.
The two types of possession consist of the transference of the Devil or demon directly
into the mortal body or the sending of the Devil or demon into the body by a third party,
usually a mortal dabbler in the dark arts. Following the act, the possessed is said to show
many symptoms including abnormal strength, personality changes, fits, convulsions, bodily
odours resembling sulphur, lewd and lascivious actions, the ability to levitate, the ability to
speak in tongues or the ability to foretell future events. Many religions acknowledge the
act of possession still today, most notably the Catholic Church. There seem to be three
ways in which to end a possession.
13. Revenance
This is the return of the dead to terrorise or to settle some score with the living.
14. Revenge
Revenge is characterized as the act of repaying someone for a harm that the person has
caused; the idea also points back generically to one of the key influences upon Gothic
literature: the revenge tragedies of Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. Revenge may be
enacted upon a loved one, a family member, a friend, an object or even an area. Within

Gothic Literature, revenge is notably prominent and can be enacted by or upon mortals
as well as spirits. Revenge can take many forms, such as harm to body, harm to loved
ones, and harm to family. The most Gothic version of revenge in Gothic Literature is
the idea that it can be a guiding force in the revenance of the dead.
15. Unreliable Narrator
A narrator tells a story and determines the story‛s point of view. An unreliable narrator,
however, does not understand the importance of a particular situation or makes an
incorrect conclusion or assumption about an event that he/she witnesses. An important
issue in determining the The Turn of the Screw.
16. Multiple Narrative/Spiral Narrative Method The story is frequently told through a
series of secret manuscripts or multiple tales, each revealing a deeper secret, so the
narrative gradually spirals inward toward the hidden truth. The narrator is often a firstperson narrator compelled to tell the story to a fascinated or captive listener
(representing the captivating power of forbidden knowledge). (Note ‘Wuthering Heights‛)
17. High, even overwrought emotion. The narration may be highly sentimental, and the
characters are often overcome by anger, sorrow, surprise, and especially, terror.
Characters suffer from raw nerves and a feeling of impending doom. Crying and emotional
speeches are frequent. Breathlessness and panic are common. In the filmed gothic,
screaming is common.
18. The Sublime: The definition of this key term has long been a contested term, but the
idea of the sublime is essential to an understanding of Gothic poetics and, especially, the
attempt to defend or justify the literature of terror.
Put basically (and this really is basic - a fuller understanding of the Sublime would be
useful to students of Wordsworth or any Gothic Literature), the Sublime is an
overpowering sense of the greatness and power of nature, which can be uplifting, aweinspiring and terrifying, caused by experience of beauty, vastness or grandeur. Sublime
moments lead us to consider the place of humanity in the universe, and the power exhibited
in the world.
19. Darkness as intrinsic to humanity: Generally speaking, gothic literature delves into
the macabre nature of humanity in its quest to satiate mankind's intrinsic desire to plumb
the depths of terror.
20. Necromancy This is the black art of communicating with the dead. This is usually
done to obtain information about the future, but can also be used for other purposes, such
as getting the dead to perform deeds of which humans are not capable. The conjurer
often stood in a circle, such as a pentagram, in order to protect himself from the dead
spirit, yet he was often overpowered by the spirit.
Examples: The most famous examples of necromancy can be found in literary renditions of
the Faust legend, from Marlowe to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe to Byron with his
Manfred. In these works, Faust not only speaks with the devil in order to strike a deal but

necromantically invokes various dead, famous figures from the past for his amusement and
edification.
21. Blood -This is a prominent symbol in Gothic works often intimating the paradox of
the human condition; blood can represent both life and death, or both guilt (e.g., murder)
and innocence (e.g., redemptive blood). Consider references to blood in ‘Macbeth‛, Byron's
Manfred and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.
22. Marriage as Resolution: The importance of marriage in this scheme cannot be
overstated. Not only does movement toward matrimony in the Gothic's present trigger the
appearance of the buried past, but that buried past itself always contains information tied
to the institutions of matrimony or family interest.
23. Sadism : The word “sadism” was coined to describe the writings of Donatien-AlphonseFrancois, the Marquis de Sade. Sadism is a sexual perversion where one person gains
gratification by inflicting physical or mental pain on others. It can also mean a delight in
torment or excessive cruelty. (Heathcliff in ‘Wuthering Heights‛ / or the husband in ‘The
Bloody Chamber‛.
24. Strong Moral Closure: If de Sade is to be believed, the Gothic genre arose as a
response to the brutality and bloodiness of Romantic society, and it as part of this
response that Gothic fiction usually contains a strong moral.
25. The metonymy of gloom and horror. Metonymy is a subtype of metaphor, in which
something (like rain) is used to stand for something else (like sorrow). For example, the
film industry likes to use metonymy as a quick shorthand, so we often notice that it is
raining in funeral scenes. Note that the following metonymies for "doom and gloom" all
suggest some element of mystery, danger, or the supernatural.
wind, especially howling
doors grating on rusty hinges
footsteps approaching
lights in abandoned rooms
characters trapped in a room
ruins of buildings
thunder and lightning
rain, especially blowing
sighs, moans, howls, eerie sounds
clanking chains

gusts of wind blowing out lights
doors suddenly slamming shut
baying of distant dogs (or wolves?)
crazed laughter
26. The vocabulary of the gothic. The constant use of the appropriate vocabulary set
creates the atmosphere of the gothic. Here as an example are some of the words (in
several categories) that help make up the vocabulary of the gothic in The Castle of
Otranto:

Mystery

diabolical, enchantment, ghost, goblins, haunted, infernal, magic,
magician, miracle, necromancer, omens, ominous, portent,
preternatural, prodigy, prophecy, secret, sorcerer, spectre, spirits,
strangeness, talisman, vision

Fear, Terror,
or Sorrow

afflicted, affliction, agony, anguish, apprehensions, apprehensive,
commiseration, concern, despair, dismal, dismay, dread, dreaded,
dreading, fearing, frantic, fright, frightened, grief, hopeless,
horrid, horror, lamentable, melancholy, miserable, mournfully, panic,
sadly, scared, shrieks, sorrow, sympathy, tears, terrible, terrified,
terror, unhappy, wretched

Surprise

alarm, amazement, astonished, astonishment, shocking, staring,
surprise, surprised, thunderstruck, wonder

Haste

anxious, breathless, flight, frantic, hastened, hastily, impatience,
impatient, impatiently, impetuosity, precipitately, running, sudden,
suddenly

Anger

anger, angrily, choler, enraged, furious, fury, incense, incensed,
provoked, rage, raving, resentment, temper, wrath, wrathful,
wrathfully

Largeness

enormous, gigantic, giant, large, tremendous, vast

27. Elements of Romance In addition to the standard gothic aspects, many gothic novels
contain elements of romance as well. Elements of romance include these:
Powerful love. Heart stirring, often sudden, emotions create a life or death
commitment. Many times this love is the first the character has felt with this
overwhelming power.
Uncertainty of reciprocation. What is the beloved thinking? Is the lover's love
returned or not?
Unreturned love. Someone loves in vain (at least temporarily). Later, the love may
be returned.
Tension between true love and father's control, disapproval, or choice. Most
often, the father of the woman disapproves of the man she loves.
Lovers parted. Some obstacle arises and separates the lovers, geographically or in
some other way. One of the lovers is banished, arrested, forced to flee, locked in a
dungeon, or sometimes, disappears without explanation. Or, an explanation may be
given (by the person opposing the lovers' being together) that later turns out to
be false.

Gothicism: In literary criticism, this refers to works characterised by a taste for the
medieval or morbidly attractive. A gothic novel prominently features elements of horror,
the supernatural, gloom, and violence: clanking chains, terror, charnel houses, ghosts,
medieval castles, and mysteriously slamming doors. The term "gothic novel" is also applied
to novels that lack elements of the traditional Gothic setting but that create a similar
atmosphere of terror or dread.
Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is perhaps the best-known English work of this kind.
Grotesque
(1) This term originated from oddly shaped ornaments found within Roman dwellings, or
grottoes, during the first century. From a literary standpoint, this term implies a
mutation of the characters, plants and/or animals. This mutation transforms the normal
features and/or behaviours into veritable extremes that are meant to be frightening
and/or disturbingly comic (Cornwell 273.
(2) The term grotesque also defines a work in which two separate modes, comedy and
tragedy, are mixed. The result is a disturbing fiction wherein comic circumstances
prelude horrific tragedy and vice versa.

<p> Critical Essays Frankenstein as a Gothic Novel </p>
<p> Frankenstein is by no means the first Gothic novel. Instead, this novel is a compilation of Romantic and Gothic elements combined into a singular work with an unforgettable story. The Gothic novel is unique because by the time Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein, several novels had appeared using Gothic themes, but the genre had only been around since 1754. </p>
<p> The first Gothic horror novel was The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole, published in 1754. Perhaps the last type of novel in this mode was Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, published in 1847. In between 1754 and 1847, several other novels appeared using the Gothic horror story as a central story telling device, The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794) and The Italian (1794) by Ann Radcliffe, The Monk (1796) by Matthew G. Lewis, and Melmouth the Wanderer (1820) by Charles Maturin. </p>
<p> Gothic novels focus on the mysterious and supernatural. In Frankenstein, Shelley uses rather mysterious circumstances to have Victor Frankenstein create the monster: the cloudy circumstances under which Victor gathers body parts for his experiments and the use of little known modern technologies for unnatural purposes. Shelley employs the supernatural elements of raising the dead and macabre research into unexplored fields of science unknown by most readers. She also causes us to question our views on Victor's use of the dead for scientific experimentation. Upon hearing the story for the first time, Lord Byron is said to have run screaming from the room, so the desired effect was achieved by Mary Shelley. </p>
<p> Gothic novels also take place in gloomy places like old buildings (particularly castles or rooms with secret passageways), dungeons, or towers that serve as a backdrop for the mysterious circumstances. A familiar type of Gothic story is, of course, the ghost story. Also, far away places that seem mysterious to the readers function as part of the Gothic novel's setting. Frankenstein is set in continental Europe, specifically Switzerland and Germany, where many of Shelley's readers had not been. Further, the incorporation of the chase scenes through the Arctic regions takes us even further from England into regions unexplored by most readers. Likewise, Dracula is set in Transylvania, a region in Romania near the Hungarian border. Victor's laboratory is the perfect place to create a new type of human being. Laboratories and scientific experiments were not known to the average reader, thus this was an added element of mystery and gloom. </p>
<p> Just the thought of raising the dead is gruesome enough. Shelley takes full advantage of this literary device to enhance the strange feelings that Frankenstein generates in its readers. The thought of raising the dead would have made the average reader wince in disbelief and terror. Imagining Victor wandering the streets of Ingolstadt or the Orkney Islands after dark on a search for body parts adds to the sense of revulsion purposefully designed to evoke from the reader a feeling of dread for the characters involved in the story. </p>
<p> In the Gothic novel, the characters seem to bridge the mortal world and the supernatural world. Dracula lives as both a normal person and as the undead, moving easily between both worlds to accomplish his aims. Likewise, the Frankenstein monster seems to have some sort of communication between himself and his creator, because the monster appears wherever Victor goes. The monster also moves with amazing superhuman speed with Victor matching him in the chase towards the North Pole. Thus, Mary Shelley combines several ingredients to create a memorable novel in the Gothic tradition. </p>

Today, however, most Gothic fiction is being published for, and read by, young people. Surprisingly, it has proved to be the ideal genre for exploring the grotesque and frightening aspects of coming of age, and metaphorically representing pressing social issues such as racism and gender inequality. </p>
<p> The phenomenally popular YA genre, targeted at readers between 12 and 18 years old, evolved from realist novels of the 1960s. These books were preoccupied with the struggles of adolescence set against a backdrop of social issues. Now, though, the genre often looks to the supernatural. Beyond Twilight, some of the most popular YA Gothic series also focus on the “lives” of vampires who are protagonists rather than foes. </p>
<p> Richelle Mead’s six-book Vampire Academy (2007-2010), now adapted into a TV series, is about a teenage girl who is a Dhampir (half-human, half-vampire). She becomes entangled in a forbidden romance with her instructor as St Vladimir’s Academy, while learning how to defeat evil vampires named Strigoi. </p>
<p> The YA Gothic revival has also embraced a wide range of supernatural entities. Cassandra Clare’s Shadowhunter Chronicles, a cross-media franchise that includes the Infernal Devices and Mortal Instruments novel series, charges angel-blooded humans with the task of protecting regular humans from a range of supernatural beings. </p>
<p> The Nephilim, or Shadowhunters, are busy controlling demons, warlocks, werewolves, faeries and vampires, but critically, it is their part-supernatural status that enables them to serve as protectors. </p>
<p> The Gothic, and its newer sub-genres like paranormal romance, have a unique resonance with teenagers. They are poised in a transitional space between childhood and adulthood, neither quite embodying the stage they are leaving behind nor fully the thing that they are in the process of becoming. It is unsurprising, then, that they have eagerly embraced the Gothic’s themes of the liminal and the monstrous, as well as its fixation on romance and sex. </p>
<p> Another significant element of the current YA Gothic revival is the emergence of the girl monster. In earlier manifestions of the “female Gothic”, first published in the 18th century by women writers, female protagonists were often courageous, but simultaneously passive and victimised. The plots of the female Gothic reflected the comparative powerlessness of women at the time and their fears about their vulnerability and entrapment within domestic roles and patriarchal society. </p>
<p> In contemporary YA Gothic, girl monsters, who can constitute a threat to others and themselves, disrupt the plotline of male monster and female victim. </p>
<p> Why now? </p>
<p> The most obvious catalyst for the embrace of Gothic conventions in literature for young people is J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series. Its popularity signalled a warm embrace of fantasy fiction that confronted the eternal dilemma of the battle between good and evil, charging a child - and later teenage protagonist - with the ability to save the world. While Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was not necessarily Gothic, the Potter phenomenon opened the way for the publication of numerous titles that embraced the possibilities of young protagonists with supernatural abilities. </p>
<p> Most significantly, Meyer’s Twilight series about human Bella Swan and “sparkling” vampire Edward Cullen, combined this staple figure of Gothic fiction with the teen romance novel. The Twilight novels were bestsellers internationally and the saga was voted into the number one position in Australian book chain Angus & Robertson’s Top 100 Books poll of 2010. The Twilight universe expanded from books into a highly successful film series. </p>
<p> The Gothic has had several major periods of popularity since its first appearance in 18th-century England, with Horace Walpole’s novel The Castle of Otranto (1764). In each subsequent revival of Gothic fiction, the genre has been reworked and reinvented to address current cultural concerns. </p>
<p> In particular, the monsters that haunt the pages of Gothic novels are transformed with shifting fears and anxieties. In her influential book Our Vampires, Ourselves Nina Auerbach explains that “every age embraces the vampire it needs”, and this comment can be extend to Gothic monsters more generally. </p>
<p> Contemporary YA fiction blurs the line between good and evil. In Gothic novels of the 19th century, monsters were usually wholly “Othered”. A Victorian-era vampire such as Stoker’s Dracula, for instance was depicted as evil, foreign, and frighteningly different to the British human. </p>
<p> But contemporary monsters are no longer necessarily imagined as racially different or set in opposition to the human. Moreover, they are often represented sympathetically, especially in stories told from their perspective. </p>
<p> These include the iZombie comic series, in which the protagonist must eat brains on a monthly basis to survive, and Claudia Gray’s Evernight series, in which the reader is not even aware that the girl protagonist is a vampire for half of the first book. Indeed, as Anna Jackson explains in New Directions in Children’s Gothic, “the monsters have become the heroes” in contemporary children’s Gothic. </p>
<p> The passive heroine </p>
<p> Most Gothic novels for young people contain a romance plot. This is often because the protagonists’ age places them in the transitional zone for entering adulthood, which is demarcated by sexual experience. </p>
<p> In a typical YA Gothic novel, such as Twilight, a plot in which a human or monstrous girl protagonist falls for a boy who is not her “type” can dissolve the boundaries between monster and human. These monstrous love interests range from traditional Gothic ones - vampires, werewolves, zombies, ghosts and witches - to newer figures such as fallen angels and faeries. The key challenge to be overcome in these novels is the barriers posed to love by supernatural monstrosity, including the physical dangers to humans, as well as social discrimination about “cross-species” love. </p>
<p> In one of few major studies of teen romance fiction, published almost 30 years ago, Linda Christian-Smith described these novels as a “site of ideological struggles for young women’s hearts and minds”. In particular, she refers to teen romance fiction’s emphasis on heteronormative coupling and motherhood. Little has changed with respect to depictions of sexuality since, despite the YA Gothic’s embrace of diverse human-monster relationships. </p>
<p> Most romances in the genre are heterosexual. They do often emphasise the heroine’s agency through her supernatural abilities and ability to choose between men or move between relationships. However, the human heroines of the Twilight series and Lauren Kate’s Fallen series, in which the heroine becomes drawn to a boy who is a fallen angel, are comparatively indecisive and continue to need rescuing. </p>
<p> Tellingly, Joss Whedon, the creator of the TV series Buffy, The Vampire Slayer (1997-2003), has described Twilight’s Bella as lacking empowerment, overly fixated on her romantic options, and “completely passive”. </p>
<p> Novels with passive human heroines allow the reader to use the fantasy of romance as a temporary escape from real-world gender inequality. Yet they also reinforce its reality for female readers. </p>
<p> The girl monster </p>
<p> Supernatural heroines, however, are often able to breach the confines of traditional femininity and become extraordinary in ways that Twilight’s Bella and other human characters cannot. In a number of YA Gothic novels, such as Mead’s Vampire Academy, the protagonists disrupt expectations of feminine behaviour because of their unique, and often poorly understood, supernatural abilities. These special powers become the focus of anxieties about the girls’ coming of age, as they pursue romances that place their broader communities under threat. </p>
<p> The Vampire Academy series was sufficiently popular in 2010 for three of its six titles to sell between 300,000 and half a million copies in hardcover in the US alone, according to Publishers Weekly. However, unlike the Twilight series, on which it likely attempted to capitalise, its protagonist, Rose, is half-vampire, half-human and a monster in her own right. Rose shares a close bond with vampire Lissa, and is driven to break the Academy’s rules in order to save her friend when she is kidnapped, highlighting that girls are also capable of protecting and rescuing people they love. </p>
<p> Vampire Academy positions Rose as a sexual object, particularly in the eyes of a privileged type of vampire (Moroi), who find Dhampir women especially attractive because of racial differences. Rose enjoys her sexuality and dresses to take advantage of it, but this sexuality operates within her definition as a strong young woman: </p>
<p> First they saw my body and the dress. Testosterone took over as pure male lust shone out of their faces. Then they seemed to realize it was me and promptly turned terrified. Cool. </p>
<p> Rose is able to reject unwelcome advances and possesses the physical strength and skills to stand up for herself, suggesting a fantasy of empowerment and equality. </p>
<p> Lissa, meanwhile, thwarts what amounts to an attempted gang rape of a drugged girl. A group of male Moroi students attempt to take advantage of a female feeder (person who permits their blood to be sucked) at a party, “doing a sort of group feeding, taking turns biting her and making gross suggestions. High and oblivious, she let them”. </p>
<p> The supernatural female protagonists in YA gothic novels are responsible for their own safety and protection, yet they also have a responsibility to keep others safe. These heroines have some romantic and sexual agency in a way that can be considered progressive. However, their desire is also framed as disruptive and dangerous and there is an obsessive fixation on the pursuit of romance above the girl’s own development, education and safety. </p>
<p> In other words, the superficially radical potential of girl heroines with superhuman physical strength, mind-reading abilities, and the potential to kill can merely be a decorative smokescreen for the reinforcement of traditional feminine values. </p>
<p> The good and monstrous within </p>
<p> The recent proliferation of Gothic YA novels is skewed toward a female readership with a focus on girl protagonists, and significant emphasis on their quest for romance. Nevertheless, there are a number of series with boy heroes. For example, Ransom Riggs’ Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children (the first book of which was recently filmed by director Tim Burton), focuses on a 16-year-old human boy, Jacob. </p>
<p> Jacob has inherited an ability that makes him uniquely able to help the supernatural peculiar children of the title, who are threatened by creatures named hollowgasts who are driven to murder peculiar children in order to feed upon their souls. For Jacob, his transition to adulthood is less about romance and more about self-discovery, connections with his ancestors, and finding a way to negotiate his new-found abilities and responsibilities. </p>
<p> In The Gothic Child, Maria Georgieva suggests that the traditional Gothic novel is preoccupied with “the growth and transformation of the child, the crisis of adolescence and the sometimes painful transition into adulthood”. She is referring to the child’s potential to grow into the hero, heroine or villain. </p>
<p> However, the recent surge in YA Gothic fiction takes this fascination with the darker aspects of childhood in a different direction. The girl heroine, in learning to manage the physical and emotional shifts of her development and more complex relationships in romance, can both be a threat and a saviour to others. </p>
<p> The fuzziness of her nature reflects both the liminal status of the teenager and new cultural understandings of the monster, who now more often resembles the typical American teen than an undead Romanian count. </p>
<p> Instead of contemplating a child’s potential to head towards either good or evil, recent Gothic YA acknowledges the possibility of both the good and the monstrous residing in one person. </p>

<p> Gothic Concepts: Grotesque </p>
<p> What is Grotesque? </p>
<p> Michel Bakhtin, in La Vie de Gargantua et de Pantagruel (his study of Rabelais; translated rather less poetically as Rabelais and His World) defines the grotesque as: ‘The lowering of all that is high, spiritual, ideal, abstract to the material level.’ </p>
<p> The grotesque body is: ‘Metamorphic’; constantly seeking to ‘link itself to other bodies or to the world outside.’ </p>
<p> According to Bakhtin, the grotesque is also surreal. </p>
<p> The surreal challenges our perceptions by blending the logical and illogical, the rational and irrational, the known and the unknown. </p>
<p> Seriously; What is Grotesque? </p>
<p> According to Bakhtin, all bodily functions are grotesque, as our insides are suddenly become part of our outsides. </p>
<p> A nosebleed, then, even on the lovely Mr Pitt, is grotesque. Often, we are meant to feel disgust when we experience the grotesque. </p>
<p> Frankenstein’s creature is one of Gothic literature’s most famous grotesques. </p>
<p> People with physical malformations or deformations are also understood to be grotesque; we are meant to feel a mix of pity and disgust when we see them. The creature’s body, comprised of scraps of dead people, should elicit those emotions in us. </p>
<p> ‘Freaks’ </p>
<p> The ‘freak shows’ of the 19th and 20th centuries made grotesques quite popular commodities in Europe and America. </p>
<p> Malformed humans were displayed for entertainment purposes; their bodies subject to invasive medical procedures; and these ‘freaks’ experienced daily humiliation. </p>
<p> The Hottentot Venus </p>
<p> Hottentot Venus was the stage name given to Sarah Baartman, a 19th century slave, originally from South Africa, who was brought to London in 1810 and displayed as a freak. </p>
<p> Baartman would be led on stage by her handler, often with a leash affixed around her neck. The genteel crowds who paid the two shilling entrance fee were permitted to poke and prod her— all of her. The size of her hips was of particular fascination to the assembled mobs. </p>
<p> Baartman was eventually sold to Georges Cuvier, a French naturalist who brought her to Paris to conduct experiments on her. She died very young, aged only twenty-six. Cuvier pickled her brain and genitals; both of which remained on display at the Musee de l’Homme until 1974. In 2002, Baartman’s remains were finally returned home to South Africa, and she was laid to rest. </p>
<p> There are hundreds of stories, undoubtedly, of the same tragic nature as Baartman’s. In the nineteenth century failed to recognise non-WASPs as proper humans—though there were some calls by the African Association to return her (circa 1812), she represented great commercial value to her owners. </p>
<p> With our modern eyes, we look back at freak shows and sideshows as a shameful relic of our collective past. But are they in the past? Consider Jeremy Kyle and Jerry Springer—aren’t their shows just the same? </p>
<p> It is human impulse, as discussed in the post on the abject to reject what is not like us; to delineate an ‘us’ and a ‘them’; to make distinctions between ‘normal’ and ‘abnormal’ bodies. Truthfully, we’re all probably a bit grotesque in our own ways. </p>

<doc id="file14873589" filename="Gothic_fiction" parent_folder="web1" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fiction">
<p> Gothic fiction, which is largely known by the subgenre of Gothic horror, is a genre or mode of literature and film that combines fiction and horror, death, and at times romance. Its origin is attributed to English author Horace Walpole, with his 1764 novel The Castle of Otranto, subtitled (in its second edition) "A Gothic Story". Gothic fiction tends to place emphasis on both emotion and a pleasurable kind of terror, serving as an extension of the Romantic literary movement that was relatively new at the time that Walpole's novel was published. The most common of these "pleasures" among Gothic readers was the sublime—an indescribable feeling that "takes us beyond ourselves."[1] The literary genre originated in England in the second half of the 18th century where, following Walpole, it was further developed by Clara Reeve, Ann Radcliffe, William Thomas Beckford and Matthew Lewis. The genre had much success in the 19th century, as witnessed in prose by Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and the works of Edgar Allan Poe as well as Charles Dickens with his novella, A Christmas Carol, and in poetry in the work of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Lord Byron. Another well known novel in this genre, dating from the late Victorian era, is Bram Stoker's Dracula. The name Gothic, which originally referred to the Goths, and then came to mean "German",[2] refers to the Gothic architecture of the medieval era of European history, in which many of these stories take place. This extreme form of Romanticism was very popular throughout Europe, especially among English- and German-language writers and artists. The English Gothic novel also led to new novel types such as the German Schauerroman and the French roman noir. </p>
<p> The Castle of Otranto (1764) is regarded as the first Gothic novel. The aesthetics of the book have shaped modern-day gothic books, films, art, music and the goth subculture.[3] </p>
<p> The novel usually regarded as the first Gothic novel is The Castle of Otranto by English author Horace Walpole, which was first published in 1764.[3] Walpole's declared aim was to combine elements of the medieval romance, which he deemed too fanciful, and the modern novel, which he considered to be too confined to strict realism.[4] The basic plot created many other staple Gothic generic traits, including threatening mysteries and ancestral curses, as well as countless trappings such as hidden passages and oft-fainting heroines. </p>
<p> Walpole published the first edition disguised as a medieval romance from Italy discovered and republished by a fictitious translator. When Walpole admitted to his authorship in the second edition, its originally favourable reception by literary reviewers changed into rejection. The reviewers' rejection reflected a larger cultural bias: the romance was usually held in contempt by the educated as a tawdry and debased kind of writing; the genre had gained some respectability only through the works of Samuel Richardson and Henry Fielding.[5] A romance with superstitious elements, and moreover void of didactical intention, was considered a setback and not acceptable. Walpole's forgery, together with the blend of history and fiction, contravened the principles of the Enlightenment and associated the Gothic novel with fake documentation. </p>
<p> Clara Reeve, best known for her work The Old English Baron (1778), set out to take Walpole's plot and adapt it to the demands of the time by balancing fantastic elements with 18th-century realism.[3] In her preface, Reeve wrote: "This Story is the literary offspring of The Castle of Otranto, written upon the same plan, with a design to unite the most attractive and interesting circumstances of the ancient Romance and modern Novel."[3] The question now arose whether supernatural events that were not as evidently absurd as Walpole's would not lead the simpler minds to believe them possible.[6] </p>
<p> Reeve's contribution in the development of the Gothic fiction, therefore, can be demonstrated on at least two fronts. In the first, there is the reinforcement of the Gothic narrative framework, one that focuses on expanding the imaginative domain so as to include the supernatural without losing the realism that marks the novel that Walpole pioneered.[7] Secondly, Reeve also sought to contribute to finding the appropriate formula to ensure that the fiction is believable and coherent. The result is that she spurned specific aspects to Walpole's style such as his tendency to incorporate too much humor or comic elements in such a way that it diminishes the Gothic tale's ability to induce fear. In 1777, Reeve enumerated Walpole's excesses in this respect: </p>
<p> a sword so large as to require an hundred men to lift it; a helmet that by its own weight forces a passage through a court-yard into an arched vault, big enough for a man to go through; a picture that walks out of its frame; a skeleton ghost in a hermit's cowl...[8] </p>
<p> Although the succession of Gothic writers did not exactly heed Reeve's focus on emotional realism, she was able to posit a framework that keeps Gothic fiction within the realm of the probable. This aspect remains a challenge for authors in this genre after the publication of The Old English Baron. Outside of its providential context, the supernatural would often suffer the risk of veering towards the absurd.[9] </p>
<p> Ann Radcliffe developed the technique of the explained supernatural in which every seemingly supernatural intrusion is eventually traced back to natural causes.[10] Radcliffe has been called both “the Great Enchantress” and “Mother Radcliffe” due to her influence on both Gothic literature and the female Gothic.[11] Radcliffe's use of visual elements and their effects constitutes an innovative strategy for reading the world through “linguistic visual patterns” and developing an “ethical gaze”, allowing for readers to visualize the events through words, understand the situations, and feel the terror which the characters themselves are experiencing.[12] </p>
<p> Her success attracted many imitators.[13] Among other elements, Ann Radcliffe introduced the brooding figure of the Gothic villain (A Sicilian Romance in 1790), a literary device that would come to be defined as the Byronic hero. Radcliffe's novels, above all The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794), were best-sellers. However, along with most novels at the time, they were looked down upon by many well-educated people as sensationalist nonsense. </p>
<p> Radcliffe also inspired the emerging idea of "Gothic feminism", which she expressed through the idea of female power through pretended and staged weakness. The establishment of this idea began the movement of the female gothic to be "challenging… the concept of gender itself".[14] </p>
<p> Radcliffe also provided an aesthetic for the genre in an influential article "On the Supernatural in Poetry",[15] examining the distinction and correlation between horror and terror in Gothic fiction,[16] utilizing the uncertainties of terror in her works to produce a model of the uncanny.[17] Combining experiences of terror and wonder with visual description was a technique that pleased readers and set Radcliffe apart from other Gothic writers.[18] </p>
<p> Developments in continental Europe and The Monk[edit] </p>
<p> English novelist's Matthew Lewis' lurid tale of monastic debauchery, black magic and diabolism entitled The Monk (1796) offered the first continental novel to follow the conventions of the Gothic novel. Though Lewis's novel could be read as a pastiche of the emerging genre, self-parody had been a constituent part of the Gothic from the time of the genre's inception with Walpole's Otranto. Lewis's portrayal of depraved monks, sadistic inquisitors and spectral nuns[19]—and his scurrilous view of the Catholic Church—appalled some readers, but The Monk was important in the genre's development. </p>
<p> The Monk also influenced Ann Radcliffe in her last novel, The Italian (1797). In this book, the hapless protagonists are ensnared in a web of deceit by a malignant monk called Schedoni and eventually dragged before the tribunals of the Inquisition in Rome, leading one contemporary to remark that if Radcliffe wished to transcend the horror of these scenes, she would have to visit hell itself.[20] </p>
<p> The Marquis de Sade used a subgothic framework for some of his fiction, notably The Misfortunes of Virtue and Eugenie de Franval, though the Marquis himself never thought of his like this. Sade critiqued the genre in the preface of his Reflections on the novel (1800) stating that the Gothic is "the inevitable product of the revolutionary shock with which the whole of Europe resounded". Contemporary critics of the genre also noted the correlation between the French Revolutionary Terror and the "terrorist school" of writing represented by Radcliffe and Lewis.[21] Sade considered The Monk to be superior to the work of Ann Radcliffe. </p>
<p> German gothic fiction is usually described by the term Schauerroman ("shudder novel"). However, genres of Gespensterroman/Geisterroman ("ghost novel"), Räuberroman ("robber novel"), and Ritterroman ("chivalry novel") also frequently share plot and motifs with the British "gothic novel". As its name suggests, the Räuberroman focuses on the life and deeds of outlaws, influenced by Friedrich von Schiller's drama The Robbers (1781). Heinrich Zschokke's Abällino, der grosse Bandit (1793) was translated into English by M.G. Lewis as The Bravo of Venice in 1804. The Ritterroman focuses on the life and deeds of the knights and soldiers, but features many elements found in the gothic novel, such as magic, secret tribunals, and medieval setting. Benedikte Naubert's novel Hermann of Unna (1788) is seen as being very close to the Schauerroman genre.[22] </p>
<p> While the term Schauerroman is sometimes equated with the term "Gothic novel", this is only partially true. Both genres are based on the terrifying side of the Middle Ages, and both frequently feature the same elements (castles, ghost, monster, etc.). However, Schauerroman's key elements are necromancy and secret societies and it is remarkably more pessimistic than the British Gothic novel. All those elements are the basis for Friedrich von Schiller's unfinished novel The Ghost-Seer (1786–1789). The motive of secret societies is also present in the Karl Grosse's Horrid Mysteries (1791–1794) and Christian August Vulpius's Rinaldo Rinaldini, the Robber Captain (1797).[23] </p>
<p> Other early authors and works included Christian Heinrich Spiess, with his works Das Petermännchen (1793), Der alte Überall und Nirgends (1792), Die Löwenritter (1794), and Hans Heiling, vierter und letzter Regent der Erd- Luft- Feuer- und Wasser-Geister (1798); Heinrich von Kleist's short story "Das Bettelweib von Locarno" (1797); and Ludwig Tieck's Der blonde Eckbert (1797) and Der Runenberg (1804).[24] Early examples of female-authored Gothic include Sophie Albrecht's Das höfliche Gespenst (1797) and Graumännchen oder die Burg Rabenbühl: eine Geistergeschichte altteutschen Ursprungs (1799).[25] </p>
<p> During the next two decades, the most famous author of Gothic literature in Germany was polymath E. T. A. Hoffmann. His novel The Devil's Elixirs (1815) was influenced by Lewis's novel The Monk, and even mentions it during the book. The novel also explores the motive of doppelgänger, the term coined by another German author (and supporter of Hoffmann), Jean Paul in his humorous novel Siebenkäs (1796–1797). He also wrote an opera based on the Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué's Gothic story Undine, with de la Motte Fouqué himself writing the libretto.[26] Aside from Hoffmann and de la Motte Fouqué, three other important authors from the era were Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff (The Marble Statue, 1819), Ludwig Achim von Arnim (Die Majoratsherren, 1819), and Adelbert von Chamisso (Peter Schlemihls wundersame Geschichte, 1814).[27] </p>
<p> Russian Gothic was not, until the 1990s, viewed as a genre or label by Russian critics. If used, the word "gothic" was used to describe (mostly early) works of Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Most critics simply used tags such as "Romanticism" and "fantastique", such as in the 1984 story collection translated into English as Russian 19th-Century Gothic Tales , but originally titled Фантастический мир русской романтической повести, literally, “The Fantastic World of Russian Romanticism Short Story/Novella”.[30] However, since the mid-1980s, Russian gothic fiction as a genre began to be discussed in books such as The Gothic-Fantastic in Nineteenth-Century Russian Literature, European Gothic: A Spirited Exchange 1760–1960, The Russian Gothic novel and its British antecedents and Goticheskiy roman v Rossii (The Gothic Novel in Russia). </p>
<p> The first Russian author whose work has been described as gothic fiction is considered to be Nikolay Mikhailovich Karamzin. While many of his works feature gothic elements, the first considered to belong purely under the gothic fiction label is Ostrov Borngolm (Island of Bornholm) from 1793.[31] Then, nearly 10 years later, Nikolay Ivanovich Gnedich followed suit with his 1803 novel Don Corrado de Gerrera, set in Spain during the reign of Philip II.[32] </p>
<p> The term "gothic" is sometimes also used to describe the ballads of Vasily Andreyevich Zhukovsky, particularly "Ludmila" (1808) and "Svetlana" (1813). The following poems are also now considered to belong to the gothic genre: Meshchevskiy's "Lila", Katenin's "Olga", Pushkin's "The Bridegroom", Pletnev's "The Gravedigger" and Lermontov's "Demon".[33] </p>
<p> The key author of the transition from romanticism to realism, Nikolai Vasilievich Gogol, who was also one of the most important authors of romanticism, produced a number of works which qualify as gothic fiction. Each of his three short story collections, feature a number of stories that fall within the gothic genre, as well as many stories that contain gothic elements. This includes: "St John's Eve" and "A Terrible Vengeance" from Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka (1831–1832); "The Portrait" from Arabesques (1835); and "Viy" from Mirgorod (1835). While all are well-known, the latter is probably the most famous, having inspired at least eight movie adaptations (two now considered lost), one animated movie, two documentaries, as well as a video game. Gogol's work differs from western European gothic fiction as his cultural influences drew from Ukrainian folklore, Cossack lifestyle and, being a very religious man, Orthodox Christianity.[36][37] </p>
<p> After Gogol, Russian literature saw the rise of realism, but many authors continued to write stories that ranged within gothic fiction territory. Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev, one of the most celebrated realists, wrote Faust (1856), Phantoms (1864), Song of the Triumphant Love (1881), and Clara Milich (1883). Another classic Russian realist, Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky, incorporated gothic elements in many of his works, although none of his novels are seen as purely gothic.[38] Grigory Petrovich Danilevsky, who wrote historical and early science fiction novels and stories, wrote Mertvec-ubiytsa (Dead Murderer) in 1879. Also, Grigori Alexandrovich Machtet wrote the story "Zaklyatiy kazak", which may now also be considered gothic.[39] </p>
<p> Further contributions to the Gothic genre were seen in the work of the Romantic poets. Prominent examples include Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Christabel as well as John Keats' La Belle Dame sans Merci (1819) and Isabella, or the Pot of Basil (1820) which feature mysteriously fey ladies.[43] In the latter poem the names of the characters, the dream visions and the macabre physical details are influenced by the novels of premiere Gothicist Ann Radcliffe.[43] Percy Bysshe Shelley's first published work was the Gothic novel Zastrozzi (1810), about an outlaw obsessed with revenge against his father and half-brother. Shelley published a second Gothic novel in 1811, St. Irvyne; or, The Rosicrucian, about an alchemist who seeks to impart the secret of immortality. </p>
<p> The poetry, romantic adventures, and character of Lord Byron—characterised by his spurned lover Lady Caroline Lamb as "mad, bad and dangerous to know"—were another inspiration for the Gothic, providing the archetype of the Byronic hero. Byron features as the title character in Lady Caroline's own Gothic novel Glenarvon (1816). </p>
<p> Byron was also the host of the celebrated ghost-story competition involving himself, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Shelley, and John William Polidori at the Villa Diodati on the banks of Lake Geneva in the summer of 1816. This occasion was productive of both Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818) and Polidori's The Vampyre (1819), featuring the Byronic Lord Ruthven. The Vampyre has been accounted by cultural critic Christopher Frayling as one of the most influential works of fiction ever written and spawned a craze for vampire fiction and theatre (and latterly film) which has not ceased to this day.[44] Mary Shelley's novel, though clearly influenced by the Gothic tradition, is often considered the first science fiction novel, despite the omission in the novel of any scientific explanation of the monster's animation and the focus instead on the moral issues and consequences of such a creation. </p>
<p> A late example of traditional Gothic is Melmoth the Wanderer (1820) by Charles Maturin, which combines themes of anti-Catholicism with an outcast Byronic hero.[45] Jane C. Loudon's The Mummy! (1827) features standard Gothic motifs, characters, and plotting, but with one significant twist: it is set in the twenty-second century and speculates on fantastic scientific developments that might have occurred four hundred years in the future, thus making it one of the earliest examples, along with Frankenstein, of the science fiction genre developing from Gothic traditions.[46] </p>
<p> By the Victorian era, Gothic had ceased to be the dominant genre, and was dismissed by most critics. (Indeed, the form's popularity as an established genre had already begun to erode with the success of the historical romance popularised by Sir Walter Scott.) However, in many ways, it was now entering its most creative phase. By the early 1800s readers and critics began to reconsider a number of previously overlooked Penny Blood or "penny dreadful" serial fictions by such authors as George W. M. Reynolds who wrote a trilogy of Gothic horror novels: Faust (1846), Wagner the Wehr-wolf (1847) and The Necromancer (1857).[47] Reynolds was also responsible for The Mysteries of London which has been accorded an important place in the development of the urban as a particularly Victorian Gothic setting, an area within which interesting links can be made with established readings of the work of Dickens and others. Another famous penny dreadful of this era was the anonymously authored Varney the Vampire (1847). Varney is the tale of the vampire Sir Francis Varney, and introduced many of the tropes present in vampire fiction recognizable to modern audiences — it was the first story to refer to sharpened teeth for a vampire.[48] The formal relationship between these fictions, serialised for predominantly working class audiences, and the roughly contemporaneous sensation fictions serialised in middle class periodicals is also an area worthy of inquiry. </p>
<p> Edgar Allan Poe was an important reinterpreter of Gothic fiction. </p>
<p> An important and innovative reinterpreter of the Gothic in this period was Edgar Allan Poe. Poe focused less on the traditional elements of gothic stories and more on the psychology of his characters as they often descended into madness. Poe's critics complained about his "German" tales, to which he replied, 'that terror is not of Germany, but of the soul'. Poe, a critic himself, believed that terror was a legitimate literary subject. His story "The Fall of the House of Usher" (1839) explores these 'terrors of the soul' while revisiting classic Gothic tropes of aristocratic decay, death, and madness.[49] The legendary villainy of the Spanish Inquisition, previously explored by Gothicists Radcliffe, Lewis, and Maturin, is based on a true account of a survivor in "The Pit and the Pendulum" (1842). The influence of Ann Radcliffe is also detectable in Poe's "The Oval Portrait" (1842), including an honorary mention of her name in the text of the story. </p>
<p> The influence of Byronic Romanticism evident in Poe is also apparent in the work of the Brontë sisters. Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights (1847) transports the Gothic to the forbidding Yorkshire Moors and features ghostly apparitions and a Byronic hero in the person of the demonic Heathcliff. The Brontës' fiction is seen by some feminist critics as prime examples of Female Gothic, exploring woman's entrapment within domestic space and subjection to patriarchal authority and the transgressive and dangerous attempts to subvert and escape such restriction. Emily's Cathy and Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre are both examples of female protagonists in such a role.[50] Louisa May Alcott's Gothic potboiler, A Long Fatal Love Chase (written in 1866, but published in 1995) is also an interesting specimen of this subgenre. </p>
<p> Elizabeth Gaskell's tales "The Doom of the Griffiths" (1858) "Lois the Witch", and "The Grey Woman" all employ one of the most common themes of Gothic fiction, the power of ancestral sins to curse future generations, or the fear that they will. </p>
<p> The genre was also a heavy influence on more mainstream writers, such as Charles Dickens, who read Gothic novels as a teenager and incorporated their gloomy atmosphere and melodrama into his own works, shifting them to a more modern period and an urban setting, including Oliver Twist (1837–8), Bleak House (1854) (Mighall 2003) and Great Expectations (1860–61). These pointed to the juxtaposition of wealthy, ordered and affluent civilisation next to the disorder and barbarity of the poor within the same metropolis. Bleak House in particular is credited with seeing the introduction of urban fog to the novel, which would become a frequent characteristic of urban Gothic literature and film (Mighall 2007). His most explicitly Gothic work is his last novel, The Mystery of Edwin Drood, which he did not live to complete and which was published in unfinished state upon his death in 1870. The mood and themes of the Gothic novel held a particular fascination for the Victorians, with their morbid obsession with mourning rituals, mementos, and mortality in general. </p>
<p> The most famous Gothic villain ever, Count Dracula, was created by Bram Stoker in his novel Dracula (1897). Stoker's book also established Transylvania and Eastern Europe as the locus classicus of the Gothic.[52] Gaston Leroux's serialized novel The Phantom of the Opera (1909–1910) is another well-known example of gothic fiction from the early 20th century. </p>
<p> In America, two notable writers of the end of the 19th century, in the Gothic tradition, were Ambrose Bierce and Robert W. Chambers. Bierce's short stories were in the horrific and pessimistic tradition of Poe. Chambers, though, indulged in the decadent style of Wilde and Machen, even to the extent of his inclusion of a character named 'Wilde' in his The King in Yellow. </p>
<p> In Ireland, Gothic fiction tended to be the purveyance of the Anglo-Irish Protestant Ascendancy. According to literary critic Terry Eagleton, Charles Maturin, Sheridan Le Fanu, and Bram Stoker form the core of the Irish gothic sub-genre with stories featuring castles set in a barren landscape and a cast of remote aristocrats dominating an atavistic peasantry, which represent in allegorical form the political plight of colonial Ireland subjected to the Protestant Ascendancy.[53] Le Fanu's use of the gloomy villain, forbidding mansion, and persecuted heroine in Uncle Silas (1864) shows the direct influence of both Walpole's Otranto and Radcliffe's Udolpho. Le Fanu's short story collection In a Glass Darkly (1872) includes the superlative vampire tale Carmilla, which provided fresh blood for that particular strand of the Gothic and influenced Bram Stoker's vampire novel Dracula (1897). </p>
<p> Irish Catholics also wrote Gothic fiction in the 19th century, so although the Anglo-Irish dominated and defined the sub-genre, they did not own it. Irish Catholic Gothic writers included Gerald Griffin, James Clarence Mangan, and John and Michael Banim. William Carleton was a notable Gothic writer, but he converted from Catholicism to Anglicanism during his life, which complicates his position in this dichotomy.[54] </p>
<p> The conventions of Gothic literature did not spring from nowhere into the mind of Horace Walpole. The components that would eventually combine into Gothic literature had a rich history by the time Walpole perpetrated his literary hoax in 1764. </p>
<p> Gothic literature is often described with words such as "wonder" and "terror."[55] This sense of wonder and terror, which provides the suspension of disbelief so important to the Gothic—which, except for when it is parodied, even for all its occasional melodrama, is typically played straight, in a self-serious manner—requires the imagination of the reader to be willing to accept the idea that there might be something "beyond that which is immediately in front of us." The mysterious imagination necessary for Gothic literature to have gained any traction had been growing for some time before the advent of the Gothic. The necessity for this came as the known world was beginning to become more explored, reducing the inherent geographical mysteries of the world. The edges of the map were being filled in, and no one was finding any dragons. The human mind required a replacement.[56] Clive Bloom theorizes that this void in the collective imagination was critical in the development of the cultural possibility for the rise of the Gothic tradition.[57] </p>
<p> The setting of most early Gothic works was a medieval one, but this had been a common theme long before Walpole. In Britain especially, there was a desire to reclaim a shared past. This obsession frequently led to extravagant architectural displays, and sometimes mock tournaments were held. It was not merely in literature that a medieval revival made itself felt, and this too contributed to a culture ready to accept a perceived medieval work in 1764.[56] </p>
<p> The Gothic often uses scenery of decay, death, and morbidity to achieve its effects (especially in the Italian Horror school of Gothic). However, Gothic literature was not the origin of this tradition; indeed it was far older. The corpses, skeletons, and churchyards so commonly associated with the early Gothic were popularized by the Graveyard Poets, and were also present in novels such as Daniel Defoe's Journal of the Plague Year, which contains comical scenes of plague carts and piles of plague corpses. Even earlier, poets like Edmund Spenser evoked a dreary and sorrowful mood in such poems as Epithalamion.[56] </p>
<p> All of the aspects of pre-Gothic literature mentioned above occur to some degree in the Gothic, but even taken together, they still fall short of true Gothic.[56] What was lacking was an aesthetic, which would serve to tie the elements together. Bloom notes that this aesthetic must take the form of a theoretical or philosophical core, which is necessary to "sav[e] the best tales from becoming mere anecdote or incoherent sensationalism."[58] In this particular case, the aesthetic needed to be an emotional one, which was finally provided by Edmund Burke's 1757 work, A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and the Beautiful, which "finally codif[ied] the gothic emotional experience."[59] Specifically, Burke's thoughts on the Sublime, Terror, and Obscurity were most applicable. These sections can be summarized thus: the Sublime is that which is or produces the "strongest emotion which the mind is capable of feeling,"; the Sublime is most often evoked by Terror; and to cause Terror we need some amount of Obscurity—we can't know everything about that which is inducing Terror—or else "a great deal of the apprehension vanishes"; Obscurity is necessary in order to experience the Terror of the unknown.[56] Bloom asserts that Burke's descriptive vocabulary was essential to the Romantic works that eventually informed the Gothic. </p>
<p> The birth of the Gothic was thought to be influenced by political upheaval beginning. Researchers linked its birth with the English Civil War and culminating in a Jacobite rebellion (1745) more recent to the first Gothic novel (1764). A collective political memory and any deep cultural fears associated with it likely contributed to early Gothic villain characters as literary representatives of defeated Tory barons or Royalists "rising" from their political graves in the pages of the early Gothic to terrorize the bourgeois reader of late eighteenth-century England.[60][61][62][63] </p>
<p> The excesses, stereotypes, and frequent absurdities of the traditional Gothic made it rich territory for satire.[64] The most famous parody of the Gothic is Jane Austen's novel Northanger Abbey (1818) in which the naive protagonist, after reading too much Gothic fiction, conceives herself a heroine of a Radcliffian romance and imagines murder and villainy on every side, though the truth turns out to be much more prosaic. Jane Austen's novel is valuable for including a list of early Gothic works since known as the Northanger Horrid Novels. These books, with their lurid titles, were once thought to be the creations of Jane Austen's imagination, though later research by Michael Sadleir and Montague Summers confirmed that they did actually exist and stimulated renewed interest in the Gothic. They are currently all being reprinted.[65] </p>
<p> Another example of Gothic parody in a similar vein is The Heroine by Eaton Stannard Barrett (1813). Cherry Wilkinson, a fatuous female protagonist with a history of novel-reading, fancies herself as the heroine of a Gothic romance. She perceives and models reality according to the stereotypes and typical plot structures of the Gothic novel, leading to a series of absurd events culminating in catastrophe. After her downfall, her affectations and excessive imaginations become eventually subdued by the voice of reason in the form of Stuart, a paternal figure, under whose guidance the protagonist receives a sound education and correction of her misguided taste.[66] </p>
<p> Notable English 20th-century writers in the Gothic tradition include Algernon Blackwood, William Hope Hodgson, M. R. James, Hugh Walpole, and Marjorie Bowen. In America pulp magazines such as Weird Tales reprinted classic Gothic horror tales from the previous century, by such authors as Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Edward Bulwer-Lytton and printed new stories by modern authors featuring both traditional and new horrors.[67] The most significant of these was H. P. Lovecraft who also wrote a conspectus of the Gothic and supernatural horror tradition in his Supernatural Horror in Literature (1936) as well as developing a Mythos that would influence Gothic and contemporary horror well into the 21st century. Lovecraft's protégé, Robert Bloch, contributed to Weird Tales and penned Psycho (1959), which drew on the classic interests of the genre. From these, the Gothic genre per se gave way to modern horror fiction, regarded by some literary critics as a branch of the Gothic[68] although others use the term to cover the entire genre. </p>
<p> In the 20th century, Gothic fiction and Modernism influenced each other. This is often most evident in detective fiction, horror fiction, and science fiction, but the influence of the Gothic can also be seen in the high literary modernism of the 20th-century, as well. Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray, published in 1890, initiates the re-working of older literary forms and myths that becomes common in the work of W. B. Yeats, T. S. Eliot, and James Joyce, among others.[69] </p>
<p> In Joyce's Ulysses, the living are transformed into ghosts, which points to an Ireland in stasis at the time, but also a history of cycles of trauma from the Great Famine in the 1840s through to the current moment of the text.[70] The way Ulysses uses tropes of the Gothic such as ghosts and hauntings while removing the literally supernatural elements of 19th-century Gothic fiction is indicative of the general form of modernist gothic writing in the first half of the 20th-century. </p>
<p> Gothic Romances of this description became popular during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, with authors such as Phyllis A. Whitney, Joan Aiken, Dorothy Eden, Victoria Holt, Barbara Michaels, Mary Stewart, and Jill Tattersall. Many featured covers depicting a terror-stricken woman in diaphanous attire in front of a gloomy castle, often with a single lit window. Many were published under the Paperback Library Gothic imprint and were marketed to a female audience. Though the authors were mostly women, some men wrote Gothic romances under female pseudonyms. For instance the prolific Clarissa Ross and Marilyn Ross were pseudonyms for the male Dan Ross, and Frank Belknap Long published Gothics under his wife's name, Lyda Belknap Long. Another example is British writer Peter O'Donnell, who wrote under the pseudonym Madeleine Brent. Outside of imprints like Love Spell, who discontinued publishing in 2010, very few books seem to be published using the term today.[71] </p>
<p> Contemporary American writers in this tradition include Joyce Carol Oates, in such novels as Bellefleur and A Bloodsmoor Romance and short story collections such as Night-Side (Skarda 1986b) and Raymond Kennedy in his novel Lulu Incognito. </p>
<p> Many modern writers of horror (or indeed other types of fiction) exhibit considerable Gothic sensibilities—examples include the works of Anne Rice, Stella Coulson, Susan Hill, Poppy Z. Brite and Neil Gaiman, as well as some of the sensationalist works of Stephen King.[73][74] Thomas M. Disch's novel The Priest (1994) was subtitled A Gothic Romance, and was partly modelled on Matthew Lewis' The Monk.[75] Many of these writers, such as Poppy Z. Brite, Stephen King and particularly Clive Barker have focused on the surface of the body and the visuality of blood.[76] The Romantic strand of Gothic was taken up in Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca (1938), which is considered by some to be influenced by Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre.[77] Other books by Du Maurier, such as Jamaica Inn (1936), also display Gothic tendencies. Du Maurier's work inspired a substantial body of "female Gothics", concerning heroines alternately swooning over or being terrified by scowling Byronic men in possession of acres of prime real estate and the appertaining droit du seigneur. </p>
<p> Educators in literary, cultural, and architectural studies appreciate the Gothic as an area that facilitates the investigation of the beginnings of scientific certainty. As Carol Senf has stated, "the Gothic was (...) a counterbalance produced by writers and thinkers who felt limited by such a confident worldview and recognized that the power of the past, the irrational, and the violent continue to hold sway in the world."[78] As such, the Gothic helps students better understand their own doubts about the self-assurance of today's scientists. Scotland is the location of what was probably the world's first postgraduate program to exclusively consider the genre: the MLitt in the Gothic Imagination at the University of Stirling, which first recruited in 1996.[79] </p>
<p> The Oscar-winning Korean-language film Parasite has been described as "Gothic" as well - specifically, "Revolutionary Gothic".[82] </p>
<p> The 1960s Gothic television series Dark Shadows borrowed liberally from the Gothic tradition and featured elements such as haunted mansions, vampires, witches, doomed romances, werewolves, obsession, and madness. </p>
<p> The Showtime TV series Penny Dreadful brings many classic gothic characters together in a psychological thriller that takes place in the dark corners of Victorian London (2014 debut). </p>
<p> Various video games feature Gothic horror themes and plots. For example, the Castlevania series typically involves a hero of the Belmont lineage exploring a dark, old castle, fighting vampires, werewolves, Frankenstein's monster, and other Gothic monster staples, culminating in a battle against Dracula himself. Others, such as Ghosts'n Goblins feature a campier parody of Gothic fiction. </p>
<p> In role-playing games (RPG), the pioneering 1983 Dungeons & Dragons adventure Ravenloft instructs the players to defeat the vampire Strahd von Zarovich, who pines for his dead lover. It has been acclaimed as one of the best role-playing adventures of all time, and even inspired an entire fictional world of the same name. "World of Darkness" is another RPG set in the real world, with the added element of the existence of a multitude of supernatural creatures such as the Werewolf, Vampire, and others. It contains sub-games, allowing you to play as a human, or as one of the inhuman creatures in the setting. My Life With Master, meanwhile, uses Gothic horror conventions as a metaphor for abusive relationships, placing the players in the shoes of the minions of a tyrannical, larger-than-life Master.[85] </p>
<p> Virginal maiden – young, beautiful, pure, innocent, kind, virtuous and sensitive. Usually starts out with a mysterious past and it is later revealed that she is the daughter of an aristocratic or noble family. </p>
<p> Matilda in The Castle of Otranto – She is determined to give up Theodore, the love of her life, for her cousin's sake. Matilda always puts others first before herself, and always believes the best in others. </p>
<p> Adeline in The Romance of the Forest – "Her wicked Marquis, having secretly immured Number One (his first wife), has now a new and beautiful wife, whose character, alas! Does not bear inspection."[86] As this review states, the virginal maiden character is above inspection because her personality is flawless. Hers is a virtuous character whose piety and unflinching optimism cause all to fall in love with her. </p>
<p> Older, foolish woman </p>
<p> Hippolita in The Castle of Otranto – Hippolita is depicted as the obedient wife of her tyrant husband, who "would not only acquiesce with patience to divorce, but would obey, if it was his pleasure, in endeavouring to persuade Isabelle to give him her hand".[87] This shows how weak women are portrayed as they are completely submissive, and in Hippolita's case, even support polygamy at the expense of her own marriage.[88] </p>
<p> Madame LaMotte in The Romance of the Forest – naively assumes that her husband is having an affair with Adeline. Instead of addressing the situation directly, she foolishly lets her ignorance turn into pettiness and mistreatment of Adeline. </p>
<p> Hero </p>
<p> Theodore in The Castle of Otranto – he is witty, and successfully challenges the tyrant, saves the virginal maid without expectations </p>
<p> Theodore in The Romance of the Forest – saves Adeline multiple times, is virtuous, courageous and brave, self-sacrificial </p>
<p> Tyrant/villain/Predatory male </p>
<p> Manfred in The Castle of Otranto – unjustly accuses Theodore of murdering Conrad. Tries to put his blame onto others. Lies about his motives for attempting to divorce his wife and marry his late son's fiancé. </p>
<p> The Marquis in The Romance of the Forest – attempts to get with Adeline even though he is already married, attempts to rape Adeline, blackmails Monsieur LaMotte. </p>
<p> Vathek – Ninth Caliph of the Abassides, who ascended to the throne at an early age. His figure was pleasing and majestic, but when angry, his eyes became so terrible that "the wretch on whom it was fixed instantly fell backwards and sometimes expired". He was addicted to women and pleasures of the flesh, so he ordered five palaces to be built: the five palaces of the senses. Although he was an eccentric man, learned in the ways of science, physics, and astrology, he loved his people. His main greed, however, was thirst for knowledge. He wanted to know everything. This is what led him on the road to damnation."[89] </p>
<p> Bandits/ruffians </p>
<p> They appear in several Gothic novels, including The Romance of the Forest, in which they kidnap Adeline from her father. </p>
<p> Clergy – always weak, usually evil </p>
<p> Father Jerome in The Castle of Otranto – Jerome, though not evil, is certainly weak, as he gives up his son when he is born and leaves his lover. </p>
<p> Ambrosio in The Monk – Evil and weak, this character stoops to the lowest levels of corruption, including rape and incest. </p>
<p> Mother Superior in The Romance of the Forest – Adeline fled from this convent because the sisters were not allowed to see sunlight. Highly oppressive environment. </p>
<p> The setting </p>
<p> The plot is usually set in a castle, an abbey, a monastery, or some other, usually religious edifice, and it is acknowledged that this building has secrets of its own. This gloomy and frightening scenery sets the scene for what the audience has already come to expect. The importance of setting is noted in a London review of The Castle of Otranto, "He describes the country towards Otranto as desolate and bare, extensive downs covered with thyme, with occasionally the dwarf holly, the rosa marina, and lavender, stretch around like wild moorlands (...) Mr. Williams describes the celebrated Castle of Otranto as 'an imposing object of considerable size (...) has a dignified and chivalric air' (...) A fitter scene for his romance he probably could not have chosen." Similarly, De Vore states, "The setting is greatly influential in Gothic novels. It not only evokes the atmosphere of horror and dread, but also portrays the deterioration of its world. The decaying, ruined scenery implies that at one time there was a thriving world. At one time the abbey, castle, or landscape was something treasured and appreciated. Now, all that lasts is the decaying shell of a once thriving dwelling."[90] Thus, without the decrepit backdrop to initiate the events, the Gothic novel would not exist. </p>
<p> Elements found especially in American Gothic fiction include: </p>
<p> Night journeys are a common element seen throughout Gothic literature. They can occur in almost any setting, but in American literature are more commonly seen in the wilderness, forest or any other area that is devoid of people. </p>
<p> Evil characters are also seen in Gothic literature and especially American Gothic. Depending on either the setting or the period from which the work came, the evil characters could be Native Americans, trappers, gold miners, etc. </p>
<p> American Gothic novels also tend to deal with a "madness" in one or more of the characters and carry that theme throughout the novel. In his novel Edgar Huntly or Memoirs of a Sleepwalker, Charles Brockden Brown writes about two characters who slowly become more and more deranged as the novel progresses. </p>
<p> Miraculous survivals are elements within American Gothic literature in which a character or characters will somehow manage to survive some feat that should have led to their demise. </p>
<p> In American Gothic novels it is also typical that one or more of the characters will have some sort of supernatural powers. In Brown's Edgar Huntly or Memoirs of a Sleepwalker, the main character, Huntly, is able to face and kill not one, but two panthers. </p>
<p> An element of fear is another characteristic of American Gothic literature. This is typically connected to the unknown and is generally seen throughout the course of the entire novel. This can also be connected to the feeling of despair that characters within the novel are overcome by. This element can lead characters to commit heinous crimes. In the case of Brown's character Edgar Huntly, he experiences this element when he contemplates eating himself, eats an uncooked panther, and drinks his own sweat. The element of fear in a female Gothic is commonly portrayed through terror and supernatural fears, while the male Gothic uses horror and physical fear and gore to create feelings of fear in the reader. </p>
<p> Psychological overlay is an element that is connected to how characters within an American Gothic novel are affected by things like the night and their surroundings. An example of this would be if a character was in a maze-like area and a connection was made to the maze that their minds represented. </p>
<p> Role of architecture and setting in the Gothic novel[edit] </p>
<p> Gothic literature is intimately associated with the Gothic Revival architecture of the same era. In a way similar to the Gothic revivalists' rejection of the clarity and rationalism of the neoclassical style of the Enlightened Establishment, the literary Gothic embodies an appreciation of the joys of extreme emotion, the thrills of fearfulness and awe inherent in the sublime, and a quest for atmosphere. </p>
<p> The ruins of Gothic buildings gave rise to multiple linked emotions by representing the inevitable decay and collapse of human creations—thus the urge to add fake ruins as eyecatchers in English landscape parks. English Gothic writers often associated medieval buildings with what they saw as a dark and terrifying period, characterized by harsh laws enforced by torture, and with mysterious, fantastic, and superstitious rituals. In literature such anti-Catholicism had a European dimension featuring Roman Catholic institutions such as the Inquisition (in southern European countries such as Italy and Spain). </p>
<p> Just as elements of Gothic architecture were borrowed during the Gothic Revival period in architecture, ideas about the Gothic period and Gothic period architecture were often used by Gothic novelists. Architecture itself played a role in the naming of Gothic novels, with many titles referring to castles or other common Gothic buildings. This naming was followed up with many Gothic novels often set in Gothic buildings, with the action taking place in castles, abbeys, convents and monasteries, many of them in ruins, evoking "feelings of fear, surprise, confinement". This setting of the novel, a castle or religious building, often one fallen into disrepair, was an essential element of the Gothic novel. Placing a story in a Gothic building served several purposes. It drew on feelings of awe, it implied the story was set in the past, it gave an impression of isolation or being cut off from the rest of the world and it drew on the religious associations of the Gothic style. This trend of using Gothic architecture began with The Castle of Otranto and was to become a major element of the genre from that point forward.[10] </p>
<p> Besides using Gothic architecture as a setting, with the aim of eliciting certain associations from the reader, there was an equally close association between the use of setting and the storylines of Gothic novels, with the architecture often serving as a mirror for the characters and the plot lines of the story.[91] The buildings in The Castle of Otranto, for example, are riddled with tunnels, which the characters use to move back and forth in secret. This secret movement mirrors one of the plots of the story, specifically the secrets surrounding Manfred's possession of the castle and how it came into his family.[92] The setting of the novel in a Gothic castle was meant to imply not only a story set in the past, but one shrouded in darkness. </p>
<p> In William Thomas Beckford's The History of the Caliph Vathek, architecture was used to both illustrate certain elements of Vathek's character and also warn about the dangers of over-reaching. Vathek's hedonism and devotion to the pursuit of pleasure are reflected in the pleasure wings he adds on to his castle, each with the express purpose of satisfying a different sense. He also builds a tall tower in order to further his quest for knowledge. This tower represents Vathek's pride and his desire for a power that is beyond the reach of humans. He is later warned that he must destroy the tower and return to Islam, or else risk dire consequences. Vathek's pride wins out and, in the end, his quest for power and knowledge ends with him confined to Hell.[93] </p>
<p> In The Castle of Wolfenbach the castle that Matilda seeks refuge at while on the run is believed to be haunted. Matilda discovers it is not ghosts, but the Countess of Wolfenbach who lives on the upper floors and who has been forced into hiding by her husband, the Count. Matilda's discovery of the Countess and her subsequent informing others of the Countess's presence destroys the Count's secret. Shortly after Matilda meets the Countess, the Castle of Wolfenbach itself is destroyed in a fire, mirroring the destruction of the Count's attempts to keep his wife a secret and how his plots throughout the story eventually lead to his own destruction.[94] </p>
<p> The picturesque and evocative ruin is a common theme in Gothic literature. This image shows the ruins of Kenilworth Castle. </p>
<p> The major part of the action in The Romance of the Forest is set in an abandoned and ruined abbey and the building itself served as a moral lesson, as well as a major setting for and mirror of the action in the novel. The setting of the action in a ruined abbey, drawing on Burke's aesthetic theory of the sublime and the beautiful established the location as a place of terror and of safety. Burke argued the sublime was a source of awe or fear brought about by strong emotions, such as terror or mental pain. On the other end of the spectrum was the beautiful, which were those things that brought pleasure and safety. Burke argued that the sublime was the more preferred to the two. Related to the concepts of the sublime and the beautiful is the idea of the picturesque, introduced by William Gilpin, which was thought to exist between the two other extremes. The picturesque was that which continued elements of both the sublime and the beautiful and can be thought of as a natural or uncultivated beauty, such as a beautiful ruin or a partially overgrown building. In The Romance of the Forest Adeline and the La Mottes live in constant fear of discovery by either the police or Adeline's father and, at times, certain characters believe the castle to be haunted. On the other hand, the abbey also serves as a comfort, as it provides shelter and safety to the characters. Finally, it is picturesque, in that it was a ruin and serves as a combination of both the natural and the human. By setting the story in the ruined abbey, Radcliffe was able to use architecture to draw on the aesthetic theories of the time and set the tone of the story in the minds of the reader. As with many of the buildings in Gothic novels, the abbey also has a series of tunnels. These tunnels serve as both a hiding place for the characters and as a place of secrets. This was mirrored later in the novel with Adeline hiding from the Marquis de Montalt and the secrets of the Marquis, which would eventually lead to his downfall and Adeline's salvation.[95] </p>
<p> Architecture served as an additional character in many Gothic novels, bringing with it associations to the past and to secrets and, in many cases, moving the action along and foretelling future events in the story. </p>
<p> The female Gothic and The Supernatural Explained[edit] </p>
<p> Characterized by its castles, dungeons, gloomy forests and hidden passages, from the Gothic novel genre emerged the female Gothic. Guided by the works of authors such as Ann Radcliffe, Mary Shelley and Charlotte Brontë, the female Gothic permitted the introduction of feminine societal and sexual desires into Gothic texts. </p>
<p> The female Gothic differs from the male Gothic through differences in narrative technique, plot, assumptions of the supernatural, and the use of terror and horror. Female Gothic narratives focus on topics of the persecuted heroine in flight from a villainous father and in search of an absent mother, while male writers tended towards a plot of masculine transgression of social taboos. The emergence of the ghost story gave female writers something to write about besides the common marriage plot, allowing them to offer a more radical critique of male power, violence and predatory sexuality.[14] </p>
<p> It has been said that medieval society, on which some Gothic texts are based, granted women writers the opportunity to attribute "features of the mode [of Gothicism] as the result of the suppression of female sexuality, or else as a challenge to the gender hierarchy and values of a male-dominated culture".[96] </p>
<p> Significantly, with the development of the female Gothic came the literary technique of explaining the supernatural. The Supernatural Explained – as this technique was aptly named – is a recurring plot device in Radcliffe's The Romance of the Forest. The novel, published in 1791, is among Radcliffe's earlier works. The novel sets up suspense for horrific events, which all have natural explanations. However, the omission of any possible explanation based in reality is what instills a feeling of anxiety and terror in both character and reader. </p>
<p> An 18th-century response to the novel from the Monthly Review reads: "We must hear no more of enchanted forests and castles, giants, dragons, walls of fire and other 'monstrous and prodigious things;'—yet still forests and castles remain, and it is still within the province of fiction, without overstepping the limits of nature, to make use of them for the purpose of creating surprise."[97] </p>
<p> Radcliffe's use of The Supernatural Explained is characteristic of the Gothic author. The female protagonists pursued in these texts are often caught in an unfamiliar and terrifying landscape, delivering higher degrees of terror. The end result, however, is the explained supernatural, rather than terrors familiar to women such as rape or incest, or the expected ghosts or haunted castles. The female Gothic also discusses women's dissatisfactions with patriarchal society, addressing the problematic and dissatisfying maternal position and role within that society.[14] Women's fears of entrapment within such elements as the domestic, the female body, marriage, childbirth, and domestic abuse are commonly portrayed through the female Gothic. The female Gothic formula is said to be "a plot that resists an unhappy or ambiguous closure and explains the supernatural".[14] </p>
<p> In Radcliffe's The Romance of the Forest, one may follow the female protagonist, Adeline, through the forest, hidden passages and abbey dungeons, "without exclaiming, 'How these antique towers and vacant courts/ chill the suspended soul, till expectation wears the cast of fear!"[97] </p>
<p> The decision of female Gothic writers to supplement true supernatural horrors with explained cause and effect transforms romantic plots and Gothic tales into common life and writing. Rather than establish the romantic plot in impossible events, Radcliffe strays away from writing "merely fables, which no stretch of fancy could realize."[98] </p>
<p> English scholar Chloe Chard's published introduction to The Romance of the Forest refers to the "promised effect of terror". The outcome, however, "may prove less horrific than the novel has originally suggested". Radcliffe sets up suspense throughout the course of the novel, insinuating a supernatural or superstitious cause to the mysterious and horrific occurrences of the plot. However, the suspense is relieved with The Supernatural Explained. </p>
<p> For example, Adeline is reading the illegible manuscripts she found in her bedchamber's secret passage in the abbey, when she hears a chilling noise from beyond her doorway. She goes to sleep unsettled, only to awake and learn that what she assumed to be haunting spirits were actually the domestic voices of the servant, Peter. La Motte, her caretaker in the abbey, recognizes the heights to which her imagination reached after reading the autobiographical manuscripts of a past murdered man in the abbey. </p>
<p> "'I do not wonder, that after you had suffered its terrors to impress your imagination, you fancied you saw specters, and heard wondrous noises.' La Motte said. </p>
<p> 'God bless you! Ma'amselle,' said Peter. </p>
<p> 'I'm sorry I frightened you so last night.' </p>
<p> 'Frightened me,' said Adeline; 'how was you concerned in that?' </p>
<p> He then informed her, that when he thought Monsieur and Madame La Motte were asleep, he had stolen to her chamber door (...) that he had called several times as loudly as he dared, but receiving no answer, he believed she was asleep (...) This account of the voice she had heard relieved Adeline's spirits; she was even surprised she did not know it, till remembering the perturbation of her mind for some time preceding, this surprise disappeared."[99] </p>
<p> While Adeline is alone in her characteristically Gothic chamber, she detects something supernatural, or mysterious about the setting. However, the "actual sounds that she hears are accounted for by the efforts of the faithful servant to communicate with her, there is still a hint of supernatural in her dream, inspired, it would seem, by the fact that she is on the spot of her father's murder and that his unburied skeleton is concealed in the room next hers".[100] </p>
<p> The supernatural here is indefinitely explained, but what remains is the "tendency in the human mind to reach out beyond the tangible and the visible; and it is in depicting this mood of vague and half-defined emotion that Mrs. Radcliffe excels".[100] </p>
<p> Transmuting the Gothic novel into a comprehensible tale for the imaginative 18th-century woman was useful for the female Gothic writers of the time. Novels were an experience for these women who had no outlet for a thrilling excursion. Sexual encounters and superstitious fantasies were idle elements of the imagination. However, the use of the female Gothic and The Supernatural Explained, are a "good example of how the formula [Gothic novel] changes to suit the interests and needs of its current readers". </p>
<p> In many respects, the novel's "current reader" of the time was the woman who, even as she enjoyed such novels, would feel that she had to "[lay] down her book with affected indifference, or momentary shame,"[101] according to Jane Austen, author of Northanger Abbey. The Gothic novel shaped its form for female readers to "turn to Gothic romances to find support for their own mixed feelings".[102] </p>
<p> Following the characteristic Gothic Bildungsroman-like plot sequence, the female Gothic allowed its readers to graduate from "adolescence to maturity,"[103] in the face of the realized impossibilities of the supernatural. As female protagonists in novels like Adeline in The Romance of the Forest learn that their superstitious fantasies and terrors are replaced with natural cause and reasonable doubt, the reader may understand the true position of the heroine in the novel: </p>
<p> "The heroine possesses the romantic temperament that perceives strangeness where others see none. Her sensibility, therefore, prevents her from knowing that her true plight is her condition, the disability of being female."[103] </p>
<p> Another text in which the heroine of the Gothic novel encounters The Supernatural Explained is The Castle of Wolfenbach (1793) by Gothic author Eliza Parsons. This female Gothic text by Parsons is listed as one of Catherine Morland's Gothic texts in Austen's Northanger Abbey. The heroine in The Castle of Wolfenbach, Matilda, seeks refuge after overhearing a conversation in which her Uncle Weimar speaks of plans to rape her. Matilda finds asylum in the Castle of Wolfenbach: a castle inhabited by old married caretakers who claim that the second floor is haunted. Matilda, being the courageous heroine, decides to explore the mysterious wing of the Castle. </p>
<p> Bertha, wife of Joseph (caretakers of the castle) tells Matilda of the "other wing": "Now for goodness sake, dear madam, don't go no farther, for as sure as you are alive, here the ghosts live, for Joseph says he often sees lights and hears strange things."[104] </p>
<p> However, as Matilda ventures through the castle, she finds that the wing is not haunted by ghosts and rattling chains, but rather, the Countess of Wolfenbach. The supernatural is explained, in this case, 10 pages into the novel, and the natural cause of the superstitious noises is a Countess in distress. Characteristic of the female Gothic, the natural cause of terror is not the supernatural, but rather female disability and societal horrors: rape, incest and the threatening control of the male antagonist. </p>
<p> There are many Gothic subgenres, including a newly-minted "environmental Gothic" or "ecoGothic".[105][106][107] The ecoGothic is a more ecologically-aware Gothic, engaging with "dark nature" and "ecophobia."[108] Writers and critics of the ecoGothic suggest that the Gothic is uniquely positioned to speak to anxieties about climate change and the planet's ecological future.[109] </p>

<p> Gothic-Grotesque of ‘Haunted’: Joyce Carol Oates’s Abjections </p>
<p> In a recent review for the New York Times, the critic Laura Miller describes Joyce Carol Oates’s novel Blonde as “the most ferocious fictional treatise ever written on the uninhabitable grotesqueness of femininity” (2000, 6). </p>
<p> Oates, for whom “the greatest realities are physical and economic” (Oates qtd. in Allen 1987, 61), has chosen the female body to stage many of the social changes of the last fifty years. </p>
<p> Contemporary artistic and academic interest in the body is a consequence of the profound transformations of Western industrial societies brought about by a number of related processes such as the new systems of production, consumption, and distribution which characterise post-Fordism as well as the cultural framework of postmodernism. </p>
<p> With the movement of industrial capitalism towards a post-industrial system based on a global economy, service industries, advertising, advanced consumption, and the manipulation of communications through public relations industries, the traditional relationship between employment, property, and the body has changed dramatically. </p>
<p> For women, these changes have been accompanied by paradoxical facts. Having achieved a degree of economic power which would have been unthinkable some decades ago, women have become powerful consumers supporting an economy whose cultural logic and marketing industries continue to objectify women’s bodies through the stylized eroticism of advertising campaigns, themselves promoters of always-innovative notions of beauty, fashion and health. But new perspectives on the body have also been a consequence of the many transformations in the private sphere. </p>
<p> The experience of physical intimacy has also changed within personal relations. Relationships are no longer exclusively based upon a property contract, nor dominated by the heterosexual paradigm but depend on a series of new expectations about personal satisfaction through intimacy and sexual contact. Women’s bodies are subject to other kinds of sexual control and scientific regulation as they are made more “efficient” and “sexy” through reproductive technologies, plastic surgery, etc. </p>
<p> These changes are responsible for the contemporary commercial interest in the body and for the pervasiveness of corporeal images not only in consumer culture, but also in art, where the body is exposed as increasingly malleable and accessible. It is thus not surprising that Western contemporary art returns to the body, no longer as a private and unified space, but made public, commodified, and disjointed. </p>
<p> In the photographs of Cindy Sherman, for instance, the body is often presented as an assembly of fragments where the female sexual organs are, critically, fetishised. Other examples of deconstructed bodies can be found in the sculpture of Louise Bourgeois, where the fragmented body is the site of challenging gender-metamorphosis and Robert Mapplethorpe’s work, where the male sexual organ is paradoxically both domesticated and sublimated. </p>
<p> Diverging from many caricatured bodies in popular art and literature, which shock the eye of the viewer (or reader) but often cannot dispute their own commodified status, Joyce Carol Oates’s characters always struggle to resist commodification and exploitation. </p>
<p> Oates’s bodies fight back, interrogating the visual/textual frames in which they are inscribed. Her characters do not, however, undergo the “fantastic” emancipation possible in the work of authors such as Angela Carter, whose magical realism offers a more drastic rewriting of our social reality. </p>
<p> Oates’s characters can only change their own plots by renegotiating their roles within the logic of the social world. Their bodies are always contextual bodies, bodies in time and bodies in history. As Marilyn C. Wesley points out, “Oates’s characters are universally repelled by the chaotic. It would be impossible for Oates’s characters to remain within the undifferentiated state of the imaginary rather than attempt to participate in the cultural organisation of the symbolic” (1995, 120). </p>
<p> Her characters are always represented in social frameworks, whose logic they have to recognise and understand so that they can eventually translate it into gestures of defiance. Novels such as ‘Them’ and ‘Marya’ convey that socialising process by staging their female protagonists’ entry into the world of language and culture, through a process which implies the redefinition of their physical selves and often the rejection of their own sexuality. The disturbance of gender categories, which is presented as a reticent process of Oates’s novels, finds an interesting terrain in her short fiction. By generating tensions between her stories, Oates creates visible dialectics within her collections which show how cultural constructions of the female body are not only painfully experienced, but also actively challenged and transformed by her heroines. </p>
<p> Joyce Carol Oates’s conscious involvement with the gothic as a specific genre — which she has called “Gothic with capital ‘G’ ” (qtd. in Johnson 1994, 18) — starts in 1977 with her short story collection ‘Nightside’ and is pursued in the early eighties with Bellefleur (1980), ‘A Bloodsmoor Romance’ (1982), and ‘Mysteries of Winterthurn’ (1984). Displaying traditional gothic devices in terms of imagery and methods of characterization, this trilogy examines America “through the prismatic lens of its most popular genres” (Oates 1988, 373). </p>
<p> Oates returns to the gothic genre in 1994 with ‘Haunted: Tales of the Grotesque’, where she takes a more conspicuously metafictional approach to the genre. This can be seen, for instance, in Oates’s rewritings of Poe’s ‘The Black Cat’ into her own ‘The White Cat’, or in her revision of Henry James’s “Turn of the Screw” as “The Accursed Inhabitants of the House of Bly”. In the first story, Oates voices the repressed sexuality of James’s ambiguous tale, and in the second story, she frames the seemingly unmotivated violence of Poe’s protagonist in the context of power/gender relations within a contemporary middle-class American family. </p>
<p> Both stories give bodies and voices to canonic female characters — the murdered wife of Poe’s narrator and Miss Jessel, the famous governess of James’s story. These two literary allusions disclose Oates’s feminist intent in reshaping the moulds of gothic literature, in order to place the female body and female subjectivity in other positions than that of ghosts or victims. </p>
<p> Oates uses the term “grotesque” in the afterword of ‘Haunted’ to define a specific aesthetic practice within gothic fiction. Referring to literary and visual arts — describing works as generically different as Gogol’s stories, Goya’s paintings, or Cronenberg’s films as representatives of the art of the grotesque — Oates characterizes the form by a “blunt physicality that no amount of epistemological exegesis can exorcise” (1994, 117), a feature which according to her distinguishes the grotesque from the more “genteel” narrative of the “Victorian ghost-story” (304). </p>
<p> As far as its emphasis on the physiological and visceral is concerned, Oates’s notion of the grotesque conforms to the notion of female gothic as described by Ellen Moers in the pioneering Literary Women. Positing that female experience can be distinguished by the tendency to “visualise the self” (1977, 90), Moers finds in the modern female gothic a specific type of spatial imagery based on portrayals of physical distortion and disfigurement. </p>
<p> Moers’s view is supported by other feminist critics such as Juliann E. Fleenor and Claire Kahane, who argue that the treatment of spatial and physical imagery in gothic literature in general, and female gothic in particular, has been dominated by feelings of fear, disgust, or self-loathing towards the female role and female sexuality. </p>
<p> Claire Kahane, for instance, rejects the dominant Oedipal paradigms in the study of gothic fiction, arguing that gothic fiction by women is defined by a primal apprehension which is directed not towards the father but towards the “mother-woman experienced as global, all-embracing, all-powerful” (1983, 243). </p>
<p> This apprehension illustrates women’s conflicts with their physical selves and is translated into the blunt physiological imagery of gothic writing by women. In this sense the fiction of Joyce Carol Oates can be placed within a tradition of women writers, which goes back to eighteenth-century author Ann Radcliffe, and is rearticulated with great disparity in the contemporary popular gothic of authors such as Phyllis Whitney and Victoria Holt, or the canonized gothic of Isac Dinesen, Carson McCullers, and Flannery O’Connor. </p>
<p> The horror of female physiology, described by many of these women writers and inscribed within the logic of patriarchal society, is often considered a result of a sense of defectiveness enforced by the patriarchal paradigm which “valorises the visible phallus as the image of autonomous power” and suggests that “women [who are] encouraged to see themselves as congenially impaired […], experience a disturbed sense of self, a feeling of lack or estrangement that gives them a special eye for the imagery of self-hatred” (244). </p>
<p> A useful way to explore the female gothic appropriation of the female body can be found in Kristeva’s concept of abjection in Powers of Horror. Drawing on Freud’s work, particularly on Totem and Taboo and Civilization and its Discontents, Kristeva’s concept of abjection plays a crucial role in explaining the formation of individual subjectivity from a pre-Oedipal perspective. </p>
<p> For Kristeva, the abject is a result of the process of individuation and complex experience of loss, which follows the separation from the mother. This loss, which constitutes language and desire, is accompanied by a necessary rejection of borderline elements (such as hair, excrements, etc.) which threaten the autonomous identity of the subject with the presence of disorder, filth, and chaos. </p>
<p> The rejection of these polluting fluids and substances — reminders of absolute connection with the mother’s body — is imposed socially by means of social rituals (such as religious practice) articulated within the logic of the Symbolic. According to Kristeva, the idea of the mother’s body as an unreachable point of origin is always associated with those defiling elements. Subsequently, all that is female is, in a way, a reminder of the mother’s abject body and is therefore presented as a threatening presence to the symbolic order. </p>
<p> Kristeva’s specific emphasis on the maternal body has been criticized, most notably, by Judith Butler, who highlights that the Kristevan maternal is problematically presented as a pre-cultural reality. In Butler’s view the abject female body is not really external to the Law of the Father: “[T]he repression of the feminine does not require that the agency of repression and the object of repression be ontologically distinct” (Butler 1999, 119). </p>
<p> The female body is constructed within paternal law, and the spectral or mythological constructions of the maternal should be understood within the Symbolic or — in Lacanian terms — according to the Law of the Father. Butler thinks that in order to avoid a self-promoted repression of the female it is necessary to take into account the full complexity and subtlety of the law and to contest the illusion of a true body beyond the law. </p>
<p> Whilst Kristeva’s notion of abjection is an extremely helpful concept for the analysis of Oates’s gothic-grotesque, where the female body is often translated into images of physical excess and disgust, it is also important to stress that, for Oates — as for Butler — the female/maternal body is always socially constructed, always experienced within the Symbolic. </p>
<p> Oates’s fiction has been continuously engaged in investigating the social practices which reinforce women’s problematical relationships with their bodies by creating various plots where her female characters always try, if unsuccessfully, to rewrite their own relationship with their mother’s bodies and their inherited narratives. For Oates’s heroines the subversion of gender discourses remains possible only through the recognition of the inscription of these categories within signification. </p>
<p> At a metafictional level, this recognition of the Law of the Father can be seen in Oates’s own approach to the “Gothic genre”. Oates draws from the mainstream discourse of canonized gothic horror (of male authors such as Poe and James, Wells and Stoker) in order to reverse gothic plots and manipulate gothic conventions, transforming the conventional gothic scripts into feminist gothic narratives. </p>
<p> Oates’s gothic fiction explores how the internalization of gender dichotomies has been perpetuated by aesthetic traditions. In the afterword of ‘Haunted’, Joyce Carol Oates refers among other writers to Bram Stoker and H. G. Wells as important practitioners of the grotesque. It is worth noting that the works by Stoker and Wells are well known for their exploration of the monstrous feminine, which Oates analyzes and rewrites in her fiction. </p>
<p> As Kelly Hurley points out, nineteenth-century gothic fiction epitomized by Stoker and Wells tended to portray the female body as “intrinsically pathological” (1996, 120): “[T]he disorders of the female body were inextricably linked to the female reproductive system, so that sexuality emerged as both casual and symptomatic of female abhumanness” (120). Along with the female vampire of Dracula, which conveys anxiety about the “new women” promoted by fin-de-siècle “feminism”, the central female character of ‘Lair of the White Worm’ (1895) by Stoker is another example of incompatible perceptions of femininity (as obtrusively sexual or asexual and chaste) of nineteenth-century gender discourses (see Hurley 1996, 122-124). </p>
<p> The abject female body in Stoker’s work is obviously that of the sexualised female, portrayed in the later novel as the metamorphosed Lady Arabella, a half-human/ half-worm creature, which lives in slime and disregards gender distinctions and modes of sexuality. The same kind of anxiety is conveyed in ‘The Island of Dr Moreau’ (1897) by H. G. Wells, another text referred to by Oates in the afterword of ‘Haunted’, where the female human-beast is portrayed as extremely repulsive (more so than her male counterpart) due to her power to provoke desire in men (human males) despite her indistinct species. </p>
<p> In twentieth-century art, film has been the privileged form for the exploration of the monstrous feminine. In the same afterword, Oates refers to David Cronenberg’s ‘Dead Ringers’ (1979) and ‘The Brood’ (1988). These two films are particularly interesting because of their use of female physiology as a form of grotesque. The protagonist in ‘Dead Ringers’ possesses a terrifying triple uterus, while in The Brood an external womb houses monstrous creatures. </p>
<p> In both films it is the female reproductive capacity, a dominant sign of sexual difference, which is rendered grotesque. In her study of the monstrous female body in contemporary film, Barbara Creed has pointed out that, like Cronenberg’s films, many other contemporary science-fiction horror movies which “represent woman as monstrous also define her primarily in relation to her sexuality, especially the abject nature of her maternal and reproductive functions” (1993, 151). Oates’s allusion to these texts conveys her interest in the exploration of the grotesque female body as written by male artists. Most of the stories of Haunted are, as we will see next, a feminist revision of the motif of the monstrous female. </p>
<p> In ‘Haunted: Tales of the Grotesque’ Oates brings back the female body to the prosaic realities of everyday life, allowing the grotesque to emerge from familiar and naturalistically constructed scenarios. The abject and its defiling substances are literalised in the daily lives of her characters. </p>
<p> As Mary Allen points out, “the female body is a liability always out of control, the centre of pain and the source of excretions that proliferate in Oates’s work: vomit, blood, diseased tissue, menstrual blood, and the newborn child itself, the most terrible excretion of all” (1987, 64). However, Oates rewrites the female body against the extra-social bodies fashioned by Wells, Stoker or Cronenberg: hers is irretrievably a socially constructed body, a body always already contextual. Oates uses physiological imagery to describe specific contexts of women’s lives in a great variety of everyday scenarios: regulation of adolescent sexuality (“Haunted”), isolation and sexual fantasies (“Phase Change”), private and public images of femininity (“The Doll”), pregnancy and motherhood (“Extenuating Circumstances”), abortion (“Don’t You Trust Me?”) and domestic abuse (“Martyrdom”). </p>
<p> Whilst many of these stories have the documentary purpose of disclosing quotidian narratives of female victimisation, we also find in ‘Haunted’ a significant number of stories which draw away from the documentary portraits suggested above to create different scenarios where the female body is an instrument of empowerment for the gothic heroine. </p>
<p> These other stories explore the traditional grotesque imagery associated with the female body but subvert plots and structures in order to challenge conventional constructions of femininity. </p>

<p> Elements of the Gothic Novel </p>
<p> Robert Harris Version Date: April 22, 2019 Previous versions: November 16, 2018; August 18, 2018; November 22, 2017; June 15, 2015 </p>
<p> The Gothic novel was invented almost single-handedly by Horace Walpole, whose The Castle of Otranto (1764) contains essentially all the elements that constitute the genre. Walpole's novel was imitated in the eighteenth century, but enjoyed widespread influence in the nineteenth century in part because of that era's indulgence in dark-romantic themes. Today, the Gothic continues to influence the novel, the short story, and poetry, and provides a major source of themes and elements in film making. (In fact, Gothic elements have been used so often in film that some have become predictable cliches. For example, when people enter an abandoned room in a supposedly abandoned house, the door often closes and locks behind them.) </p>
<p> Gothic elements include the following: </p>
<p> 1. Setting in a castle or old mansion. The action takes place in and around an old castle or an old mansion, or the ruins of an old castle or mansion. Sometimes the edifice is seemingly abandoned, sometimes occupied, and sometimes it's not clear whether the buildidng has occupants (human or otherwise). The castle often contains secret passages, trap doors, secret rooms, trick panels with hidden levers, dark or hidden staircases, and possibly ruined sections. The castle may be near or connected to caves, which lend their own haunting flavor with their darkness, uneven floors, branchings, claustrophobia, echoes of unusual sounds, and mystery. And in horror-Gothic, caves are often seem home to terrifying creatures such as monsters, or deviant forms of humans: vampires, zombies, wolfmen. Translated into the modern novel or filmmaking, the setting is usually an old house or mansion--or even a new house--where unusual camera angles, sustained close ups during movement, and darkness or shadows create the same sense of claustrophobia and entrapment. The house might be already dark, perhaps because it was abandoned, or it might at first seem light and airy, but either night comes and people turn off the lights to go to bed, or at some dramatic point the lights will fail (often because of a raging storm). (And, as movie goers know well, while the scenes and dialog form the rational (or irrational) movement in the film, the music controls the emotional response to what is seen and spoken.) The goal of the dark and mysterious setting is to create a sense of unease and foreboding, contributing toward the atmospheric element of fear and dread. Darkness also allows those sudden and frightening appearances of people, animals, ghosts, apparent ghosts, or monsters. </p>
<p> 2. An atmosphere of mystery and suspense.The work is pervaded by a threatening feeling, a fear enhanced by the unknown. This atmosphere is sometimes advanced when characters see only a glimpse of something--was that a person rushing out the window or only the wind blowing a curtain? Is that creaking sound coming from someone's step on the squeaky floor, or only the normal sounds of the night? Often the plot itself is built around a mystery, such as unknown parentage, a disappearance, or some other inexplicable event. People disappear or show up dead inexplicably. Elements 3, 4, and 5 below contribute to this atmosphere. </p>
<p> In modern novels and filmmaking, the inexplicable events are often murders. The bodies are sometimes mutilated in ways that defy explanation--"What kind of monster could do this?" or "Here's the body, but there's no blood." When the corpses start to mount, suspense is raised as to who will get killed next. Another modern setting that lends itself well to the sense of suspense and even entrapment is a supposedly deserted island, where the characters have arrived by shipwreck or mysterious invitation. Their way back to civilization has been cut off (the airplane ran out of fuel or crash landed, the boat sank, etc.). Who knows? They might even run into living dinosaurs. </p>
<p> 3. An ancient prophecy is connected with the castle or its inhabitants (either former or present). The prophecy is usually obscure, partial, or confusing. "What could it mean?" In more watered down modern examples, this may amount to merely a legend: "It's said that the ghost of old man Krebs still wanders these halls." Ancient, undecipherable maps showing the location of amazing treasure represent another variant of the ancient prophecy aspect. </p>
<p> 4. Omens, portents, visions. A character may have a disturbing dream vision, or some phenomenon may be seen as a portent of coming events. For example, if the statue of the lord of the manor falls over, it may portend his death. In modern fiction, a character might see something (a shadowy figure stabbing another shadowy figure) and think that it was a dream. This might be thought of as an "imitation vision." Sometimes an omen will be used for foreshadowing, while other writers will tweak the reader by denying expectation--what we thought was foreshadowinig wasn't. </p>
<p> 5. Supernatural or otherwise inexplicable events. Dramatic, amazing events occur, such as ghosts or giants walking, or inanimate objects (such as a suit of armor or painting) coming to life. In some works, the events are ultimately given a natural explanation, while in others the events are truly supernatural. As you might imagine, Hollywood uses special effects to a large degree to provide fire, earthquakes, moving statues, and so forth, often bluring the line between human-produced, natural, and supernatural events. </p>
<p> 6. High, even overwrought emotion. The narration may be highly sentimental, and the characters are often overcome by anger, sorrow, surprise, fear, and especially, terror. Characters suffer from raw nerves and a feeling of impending doom. Crying and emotional speeches are frequent. Breathlessness and panic are common. In the filmed Gothic, screaming is common. </p>
<p> 7. Women in distress. As an appeal to the pathos and sympathy of the reader, the female characters often face events that leave them fainting, terrified, screaming, and/or sobbing. A lonely, pensive, and oppressed heroine is often the central figure of the novel, so her sufferings are even more pronounced and the focus of attention. The women suffer all the more because they are often abandoned, left alone (either on purpose or by accident), and have no protector at times. (In horror-Gothic films, when the guy tells the girl, "Stay here; I'll be right back," you pretty much know that one of them will soon be dead.) </p>
<p> 8. Women threatened by a powerful, impulsive, tyrannical male. One or more male characters has the power, as king, lord of the manor, father, or guardian, to demand that one or more of the female characters do something intolerable. The woman may be commanded to marry someone she does not love (it may even be the powerful male himself), or commit a crime. In modern Gothic novels and films, there is frequently the threat of physical violation. </p>
<p> 9. The metonymy of gloom and horror. Metonymy is a subtype of metaphor, in which something (like rain) is used to stand for something else (like sorrow). For example, the film industry likes to use metonymy as a quick shorthand, so we often notice that it is raining in funeral scenes. (This explains why they never oil the hinges on the doors in Gothic novels.) Note that the following metonymies for "doom and gloom" all suggest some element of mystery, danger, or the supernatural. </p>
<p> 10. The vocabulary of the Gothic. The constant use of the appropriate vocabulary set creates an sustains the atmosphere of the Gothic. Using the right words maintains the dark-and-stimulated feel that defines the Gothic. Here as an example are some of the words (in several categories) that help make up the vocabulary of the Gothic in The Castle of Otranto: </p>
<p> Mystery </p>
<p> diabolical, enchantment, ghost, goblins, haunted, infernal, magic, magician, miracle, necromancer, omens, ominous, portent, preternatural, prodigy, prophecy, secret, sorcerer, spectre, spirits, strangeness, talisman, vision </p>
<p> enormous, gigantic, giant, large, tremendous, vast </p>
<p> Darkness </p>
<p> dark, darkness, dismal, shaded, black, night </p>
<p> 11. Hyperbolic Phrases. In the advertising business, it is sometimes said, "The lie is in the adjective." Adjectives control how we think of the nouns they modify: "mild curiosity" presents an attitude of relaxed interest, whereas "insatible curiosity" presents the attitude of a hungry mind. In the Gothic, adjectives are used to amplify nouns in order to (1) create phrases that increase the feeling of dread, horror, anxiety, or suspense, or (2) produce a substantially increased emphasis or sense of importance. Here are some examples from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein: </p>
<p> 12. The Onomatopoeia of the Gothic. Onomatopoeic words resemble the sound they name. For example, "buzz" when spoken supposedly resembles the sound of a buzzer. Many onomatopoeias are not very close in actual sound, but they convey the meaning to the reader. Here are some onomatopoeias frequent in Gothic works, allowing appropriate fearful sound effects to arise from the printed word. </p>
<p> Walpole himself lays on most of these elements pretty thick (although he's a lot lighter on darkness than many modern Gothic works), so it might be said that another element of the classic Gothic is its intensity created by profuse employment of the vocabulary of the Gothic. Consider this from Chapter 1 of The Castle of Otranto: The servant "came running back breathless, in a frantic manner, his eyes staring, and foaming at the mouth. He said nothing but pointed to the court. The company were struck with terror and amazement." Gets your interest up on page two, doesn't he? Then, "In the meantime, some of the company had run into the court, from whence was heard a confused noise of shrieks, horror, and surprise." The Castle of Otranto is available at Amazon.com </p>
<p> An Example </p>
<p> The 1943 Sherlock Holmes film, Sherlock Holmes Faces Death (one of the classic Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce films), contains all the elements of the Gothic. Here is a brief rundown of the items above: </p>
<p> 1. Setting. It's not quite a castle, but it is a huge mansion with several levels, including a basement and a hidden sub-basement. Dark and drafty. Ominous. </p>
<p> 2. Atmosphere of Mystery. It's a multiple murder mystery, with cryptic notes, hidden passageways, wind, lightning, and everyone a suspect. </p>
<p> 3. Ancient Prophecy. There is the Musgrave Ritual. Obscure, compelling, ancient. </p>
<p> 4. Omens and portents. The crow at the tavern, the intrusive lightning strike, the taunting notes from the butler. </p>
<p> 5. Supernatural or inexplicable events. How the victims died. The lightning seems to strike at just the right time. </p>
<p> 6. Overwrought emotion. The female lead screams and panics a bit. </p>
<p> 7. Women in distress and 8. Women threatened by a male. Toned down here, but the murderer had designs on the heroine. </p>
<p> 9. The wind blows, signs bang into the wall, lightning, a few characters are trapped in various ways. </p>
<p> Elements of Romance </p>
<p> In addition to the standard Gothic machinery above, many Gothic novels contain elements of romance as well. Elements of romance include these: </p>
<p> 1. Powerful love. Heart stirring, often sudden, emotions create a life or death commitment. Many times this love is the first the character has felt with this overwhelming power. </p>
<p> 2. Uncertainty of reciprocation. What is the beloved thinking? Is the lover's love returned or not? </p>
<p> 3. Unreturned love. Someone loves in vain (at least temporarily). Later, the love may be returned. </p>
<p> 4. Tension between true love and father's control, disapproval, or choice. Most often, the father of the woman disapproves of the man she loves. </p>
<p> 5. Lovers parted. Some obstacle arises and separates the lovers, geographically or in some other way. One of the lovers is banished, arrested, forced to flee, locked in a dungeon, or sometimes, disappears without explanation. Or, an explanation may be given (by the person opposing the lovers' being together) that later turns out to be false. </p>
<p> 6. Illicit love or lust threatens the virtuous one. The young woman becomes a target of some evil man's desires and schemes. </p>
<p> 7. Rival lovers or multiple suitors. One of the lovers (or even both) can have more than one person vying for affection. </p>

<p> In the most general terms, ​Gothic literature can be defined as writing that employs dark and picturesque scenery, startling and melodramatic narrative devices, and an overall atmosphere of exoticism, mystery, fear, and dread. Often, a Gothic novel or story will revolve around a large, ancient house that conceals a terrible secret or serves as the refuge of an especially frightening and threatening character. </p>
<p> Despite the fairly common use of this bleak motif, Gothic writers have also used supernatural elements, touches of romance, well-known historical characters, and travel and adventure narratives to entertain their readers. The type is a subgenre of Romantic literature—that's Romantic the period, not romance novels with breathless lovers with wind-swept hair on their paperback covers—and much fiction today stems from it. </p>
<p> Development of the Genre </p>
<p> Gothic literature developed during the Romantic period in Britain. The first mention of "Gothic," as pertaining to literature, was in the subtitle of Horace Walpole's 1765 story "The Castle of Otranto: A Gothic Story" which was supposed to have been meant by the author as a subtle joke—"When he used the word it meant something like ‘barbarous,’ as well as ‘deriving from the Middle Ages." In the book, it's purported that the story was an ancient one, then recently discovered. But that's just part of the tale. </p>
<p> The supernatural elements in the story, though, launched a whole new genre, which took off in Europe. Then America's Edgar Allen Poe got ahold of it in the mid-1800s and succeeded like no one else. In Gothic literature, he found a place to explore psychological trauma, the evils of man, and mental illness. Any modern-day zombie story, detective story, or Stephen King novel owes a debt to Poe. There may have been successful Gothic writers before and after him, but no one perfected the genre quite like Poe. </p>
<p> Major Gothic Writers </p>
<p> A few of the most influential and popular 18th-century Gothic writers were Horace Walpole (The Castle of Otranto, 1765), Ann Radcliffe (Mysteries of Udolpho, 1794), Matthew Lewis (The Monk, 1796), and Charles Brockden Brown (Wieland, 1798). </p>
<p> The genre continued to command a large readership well into the 19th century, first as Romantic authors such as Sir Walter Scott (The Tapestried Chamber, 1829) adopted Gothic conventions, then later as Victorian writers such as Robert Louis Stevenson (The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, 1886) and Bram Stoker (Dracula, 1897) incorporated Gothic motifs in their stories of horror and suspense. </p>
<p> Elements of Gothic fiction are prevalent in several of the acknowledged classics of 19th-century literature, including Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818), Nathaniel Hawthorne's The House of the Seven Gables (1851), Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre (1847), Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1831 in French), and many of the tales written by Edgar Allan Poe such as "The Murders in the Rue Morgue” (1841) and "The Tell-Tale Heart" (1843). </p>
<p> Influence on Today's Fiction </p>
<p> Today, Gothic literature has been replaced by ghost and horror stories, detective fiction, suspense and thriller novels, and other contemporary forms that emphasize mystery, shock, and sensation. While each of these types is (at least loosely) indebted to Gothic fiction, the Gothic genre was also appropriated and reworked by novelists and poets who, on the whole, cannot be strictly classified as Gothic writers. </p>
<p> In the novel Northanger Abbey, Jane Austen affectionately showcased the misconceptions and immaturities that could be produced by misreading Gothic literature. In experimental narratives such as The Sound and the Fury and Absalom, Absalom! William Faulkner transplanted Gothic preoccupations—threatening mansions, family secrets, doomed romance—to the American South. And in his multigenerational chronicle One Hundred Years of Solitude, Gabriel García Márquez constructs a violent, dreamlike narrative around a family house that takes on a dark life of its own. </p>
<p> Similarities With Gothic Architecture </p>
<p> There are important, though not always consistent, connections between Gothic literature and Gothic architect. Gothic structures, with their abundant carvings, crevices, and shadows, can conjure an aura of mystery and darkness and often served as appropriate settings in Gothic literature for the mood conjured upthere. Gothic writers tended to cultivate those emotional effects in their works, and some of the authors even dabbled in architecture. Horace Walpole also designed a whimsical, castle-like Gothic residence called Strawberry Hill. </p>

<p> Gothic Literature A darkened room and a secret passage, a beautiful heroine in a flowing nightgown, candles that go out and doors that mysteriously open are all trademarks of the gothic literature tradition. Dark and stormy nights where a young woman is trapped in an unfamiliar place with individuals who have nefarious purposes are the norm and unfortunately for a heroine in a gothic novel, it is unlikely that she will make it out of the story unscathed. So ingrained are the icons and stereotypes of the gothic tradition that they are still found in horror or suspense to this day, as well as those which parody the style. In works of gothic literature, there are characteristics which clearly classify the novels into the genre and without these trademark criterion, the novel cannot be claimed to be part of the gothic branch of literary works.

<p> Relationship of "The Old English Baron" and "Vathek" to 18th Century English Gothic Fiction The rise of Gothic fiction in English literature coincided with the advent of the Romantic Era at the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th century. Gothic masterpieces such as Shelley's Frankenstein, Lewis's The Monk, and Stoker's Dracula would capture the imagination by fueling it with the flames of horror, suspense, other-worldliness and mystery. These elements are significant because the Age of Enlightenment had been characterized by a cold, objective, analytical focus on nature and humankind. It had been based on the concept that reason was sufficient to explain all events in the world and in fact all creation. Yet as Shakespeare's Hamlet reminded readers, "There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, / Than are dreamt of in your philosophy" (Shakespeare 1.5.167-168). Part of this interest in the Gothic was inspired…… [Read More] </p>

<p> The lack of rights within marriage that makes women basically "property" to the man is obviously central to this story, as indicated by the way in which Maria is imprisoned. There are a variety of ways in which this most disturbing of issues is addressed in the book. Women who are married loose control over their own bodies, and are required to submit to caresses to which their soul does not consent. One woman in the madhouse is, in fact, there specifically because she could not tolerate her husband's caresses. "she had been married, against her inclination, to a rich old man,... In consequence of his treatment... she had... lost her senses." (1.39) Not only is a woman prone to institutionalized rape, but she also has no right to require the man to remain as he was before they wed. Maria declaims bitterly of how her husband deteriorates into a…… [Read More] </p>

<p> The very description of the dog conjures up an image of a massive dog, wearing a studded and dangerous collar, salivating in wait for any evil attempt at entering the castle. The mastiff old did not awake, Yet she an angry moan did make! And what can ail the mastiff *****? Never till now she uttered yell Beneath the eye of Christabel" (Coleridge) Christabel fails to heed the warning of the mastiff, and so, her fate is sealed. The image of the mastiff is cruel and powerful, and yet, Geraldine's power is even stronger, for she can keep the mastiff still and keep the warning from registering with Christabel. Thus, her evil is powerful indeed, more powerful than the other gothic motifs in the poem. 8. The dead mother is yet another important motif in the poem. She adds to the tragedy of Christabel's life, and Coleridge makes it quite…… [Read More] </p>

<p> Gothic Cathedrals and Light From the end of the 12th century for at least two centuries architecture underwent a revolution known as Gothic. Much like classical architecture, changes in building paralleled changes in culture. Gothic works tended to be tall, inspiring, and meant to withstand the ravages of time. Structural improvements were massive, and even though this era only lasted 200 years, it would have a profound effect on any building style from then on. The epitome of the style was, of course, the cathedral, which was meant to convey humanity's communication with God. The technological improvements that allowed arches, high ceilings, and massive glass works were specific to the larger than life view of the Church, and to inspire the peasantry when attending special services (Frankl, 2001). Gothic art and architecture is a Medieval movement that evolved out of omanesque art, in the mid-12th century, in Europe. It spread…… [Read More] </p>

<p> This type of fluidization announces the Renaissance and is probably an expression of the new opening that the society goes through as it comes out of the Middle Ages. A greater creative expression in literature or painting, for example, had to be matched by a similar trend in architecture. Another interesting comparison with the previous Gothic styles is the fact that, in the past, the Gothic style was used almost exclusively for religious constructions, notably churches. With the Flamboyant Gothic, numerous secular buildings, either town halls, castles or individual houses are built in this style, more appropriate for the expression of an individual home. Ornament seems to be the common denominator for most of the constructions that were created in a Flamboyant Gothic style starting with the middle of the 14th century and all the way into the 16th century. The preference for ornament over the simple construction elements has…… [Read More] </p>

<p> William of Occam formulated the principle of Occam's Razor, which held that the simplest theory that matched all the known facts was the correct one. At the University of Paris, Jean Buridan questioned the physics of Aristotle and presaged the modern scientific ideas of Isaac Newton and Galileo concerning gravity, inertia and momentum when he wrote: ...after leaving the arm of the thrower, the projectile would be moved by an impetus given to it by the thrower and would continue to be moved as long as the impetus remained stronger than the resistance, and would be of infinite duration were it not diminished and corrupted by a contrary force resisting it or by something inclining it to a contrary motion (Glick, Livesay and Wallis 107) Thomas Bradwardine and his colleagues at Oxford University also anticipated Newton and Galileo when they found that a body moving with constant velocity travels distance…… [Read More] </p>

<p> Skin Shows: Gothic Horror and the Technology of Monstrosity by Judith Halberstam The Gothic Tradition Judith Halberstam discusses many different facets of the Gothic tradition in the first chapter of her book entitled Skin Shows: Gothic Horror and the Technology of Monstrosity. For the most part, this chapter is extremely dense and fragmented. The author spends the bulk of it discussing several different aspects of the Gothic, and telling the reader about things that she "will" discuss. As such, she covers a range of topic, yet none of them are done so in an amount of depth that will help the reader to understand the significance of these points. Still, there are some basic points which she manages to make clear. She pinpoints the Gothic tradition as stemming from 18th century literature, and believes that this tradition has gone on to change media and reproduce itself within the medium of…… [Read More] </p>

<p> Portrayal of Gothic Femininities in "The Monk" Written by Matthew Gregory Lewis in 1796, "The Monk" is a classic novel that is from Gothic literature. Female figures are used as symbols in many parts of the story, and the idea "gothic femininity" can be seen several times throughout the story. The setting fits with the Gothic theme as the story's beginning takes place in a mysterious church in Madrid, and the two main characters are both women. Leonella and her niece Antonia have come to the church to hear a great priest named Ambrosio speak, and what follows becomes both a romance and a tragedy. While waiting for Ambrosio to speak the two women tell their stories to a pair of men, Don Lorenzo and Don Christoval, and this conversation starts a chain of reactions that changes many lives. Lorenzo falls in love with Antonia, but she desires the priest…… [Read More] </p>

<p> It is interesting, however, that Coleridge chose to describe two women in a homoerotic situation since lesbianism was practically unheard of at the time whereas male homosexuality, though illegal, was at least recognized. It's even more interesting in the face of Coleridge's history of unease with women (Grossberg 152). The two main characters in this piece are Christabel and Geraldine. Geraldine's appearance coincides with a mysterious sound that is never identified, and is but one indication of her supernatural origins. It has been suggested that Geraldine is the first appearance of a vampire in literature, though she is referred to as a witch in the text itself. She has a strongly homoerotic connection to Christabel, one of Sir Leoline's, the baron who owns the castle where the poem takes place, daughters. Christabel is enchanted by Geraldine, whether literally or figuratively, though she is terrified as well. Essentially Christabel and Geraldine…… [Read More] </p>

<p> Music, Art, Literature Trends From impressionism to pop art, jazz to hip hop, science fiction to beat poetry, artistic, musical, and literary expressions have varied considerably between 1870 and 2005. The period between the end of the nineteenth century to the current day can be generally described as the modern and postmodern eras. The beginning of the modern era, during the final decades of the nineteenth century, coincided with the Industrial evolution. Along with fascination with modern technology and optimism for the future came simultaneous disillusionment. However, modern technological advancements have made such widespread creativity possible. Social and political trends have also influenced creative endeavors, and vice-versa. Art, music, and literature are more accessible and more possible to create than they ever were in the past. The modern era has been characterized by an overall flourishing of the expressive arts, but some trends have a more lasting significance than others.…… [Read More] </p>
<p> Rock music became more than just a musical trend; it also characterized the rise of the teenage culture, symbolized rebellion, and influenced political and social attitudes. Furthermore, rock and roll remains a viable creative endeavor today, and is also internationally popular, which is why the trend is so important. Beyond rock and roll, electronic music and hip hop are recent significant musical trends. Electronic music has been around for decades, and reached a peak with the advent of the rave. Electronic music remains a vital force in the industry, and has also impacted the development of hip hop. Hip-hop is yet another musical trend that coincides with social and race-related realities in the United States. The genre is so important because it represents American urban culture. Among the literary trends between 1870 and the present day, the most significant ones include post-colonialism, science fiction, beat poetry, and horror. Post-colonial literature such as the works of Joseph Conrad brought awareness to the problems associated with the colonialist mentality. Post-colonial fiction put a human face on the very real political, social, and economic issues of the modern world. Realism was a major literary method used by post-colonial authors, who depicted their worlds with stunning detail. With the modern fascination with technological advancements, science fiction became a highly significant literary trend to emerge during the twentieth century. Science fiction originated in the early twentieth century when Orson Welles' reading of H.G. Wells' novel the War of the Worlds shocked the nation into believing that aliens had indeed attacked the United States. Science fiction literature strongly influenced television and film, too, and is responsible for the popularity of both Star Trek and Star Wars. Related to but different from science fiction, fantasy writing also emerged during this time and gave rise to the writings of J.R.R. Tolkein, whose works recently spawned motion pictures. Another significant literary trend to emerge during the middle of the twentieth century was beat poetry and beat literature. Beat poetry was completely free verse and free form, in sharp contrast to earlier, more structured forms. Moreover, beat poetry was far more abstract than previous works. Just as modern art was becoming more abstract and expressionist, so too was literature. Another key literary trend to emerge during the past century was horror fiction. While horror derives from earlier Gothic literature as well as from science fiction, the horror genre has had a huge impact on modern literary expression. Authors like Stephen King have become immensely famous by making people afraid, and his works as well as the works of countless other horror writers have impacted the plots and themes of films and television shows. </p>

<p> role of religion in the history of European society is a tumultuous one. Christianity, from its obscure beginnings in the classical age, eventually took the reins as the centerpiece of philosophical, literary, and scientific thought. It is true that religion, often, tends to justify actions that might objectively be perceived as incongruous to the established faith. It has historically been the case that when traditional forms of worship become threatened, morally questionable methods are undertaken to strengthen the order. This is certainly the case with Christianity. Since the birth of the Catholic Church in the Roman Empire, Church officials have actively attempted to make their privileged positions in society impervious to assault -- this process has progressed for centuries and, indeed, tens of centuries. For many years this single faith dominated nearly every aspect of European society and was a strong force in maintaining the status quo. However, the many…… [Read More] </p>

<p> The unusual event of resurrection is a theme particularly apparent within the stories "The Fall of the House of Usher" and "Ligeia." In the latter story resurrection occurs after the Lady Rowena's corpse finally resurrects itself into the form of Lady Ligeia. In the former story "resurrection" actually occurs when the Lady Madeline, after recovering from her cataleptic state, manages to escape from her tomb. In two of Poe's stories certain unusual and grotesque events occur that are unique to those tales. The story "illiam ilson" contains a doppelganger theme, which is unique to it. In the story "The Masque of the Red Death" the uniquely violent and unusual event is the characters unknowingly making an unfortunate encounter with the personification of the Red Death disease while they are busily engaged in their festivities. Bizarre forms of death are a pervasive feature in Poe's short stories. Nowhere is it more…… [Read More] </p>

<p> Japanese Lit The most salient motif connecting Basho's "Oku no Hosomichi" with Kyoka's "The Holy Man of Mount Koya" is the journey. A journey provides the pivotal experience for the hero, who is personally transformed by the journey. The hero's journey is more than one of self-discovery, for through the journey, they hero touches upon deeper metaphysical issues. The heroes on their respective journeys in these two stories undergo similar emotional experiences and transformations. For example, both struggle to face and overcome their own fears. Both Basho and the narrator of "The Holy Man of Mount Koya" need to go through extreme weariness during the process of the journey, for from their point of exhaustion a new type of energy may arise. Sexuality and erotic imagery is present, albeit in subtle and symbolic ways, in these two journeys. Thus, issues related to temptation become important lessons for the heroes.

Far from being Edward's victim, or used as a pawn and discarded, she is eager to leave her dull, empty middle class life behind and become part of the Cullen vampire family. When she nearly dies giving birth to their half-vampire daughter, Edward finally does 'turn' her to save her life, and to paraphrase the title of the old song, we can only hope that she is satisfied.

<p> Gothic and Edgar Allan Poe's Tamerlane And Other Poems The writing of Edgar Allan Poe will always be connected to the gothic style of literature because Poe used death, mourning and sadness as major themes, and his first published work actually shows some of the style that would make him famous later in life. Published in 1827 when Poe was just a young man of 18-years old, the book Tamerlane and Other Poems contained several poems written when Poe was just a teenager. Because the poetry was the work of such a young man, Poe made sure to tell readers in the Preface that "they were of course not intended for publication; why they are now published concerns no one but himself. Of the smaller pieces very little need be said: they perhaps savour too much of egotism; but they were written by one too young to have any knowledge…… [Read More] </p>

<p> American and European Literature Suggesting that there is a fundamental difference between American and European literature means much more than acknowledging that the culture produced by geographically distinct regions is similarly distinct, because it suggests that there are much deeper underlying symbols and tropes which mark these cultural productions as distinctly American or European regardless of the wide variety of genres and themes present in the literature of either region. hile the claim of an identifiable distinction between American and European literature feels accurate due to the clear differences between American and European culture, this claim requires critical examination because of the potential for stereotype and condescension inherent in it.

In fact, the absence of religion and religious restraints appears to be an element of Stevenson's theme: Jekyll, acting on the doctrine of Rousseau, which is to follow one's "nature," unmoors himself from the restraints traditionally made available by religious conviction. Jekyll, being a man of science, rather than of theology, puts to test the doctrine that divorced the old world from the new, and what he finds is that the doctrine is not good. hile the earlier works of gothic horror (like The Monk) pointed out corruption within the clergy, Stevenson's gothic work appears to do the opposite: it points out the corruption in Naturalism: "I not only recognised my natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain of the powers that made up…… [Read More] </p>

<p> Parasites and Perverts: An Introduction to Gothic Monstrosity, by Judith Halberstam. Specifically, it will relate the essay to the movie Candyman, directed by Bernard ose. CANDYMAN In "Parasites and Perverts," Halberstam discusses the Gothic novel, and how it relates to horror writing and horror films today. According to Halberstam, classic Gothic writing embodies monstrosity, fear, sexuality, and horror. As the author notes, "Horror, I have suggested, exercises power even as it incites pleasure and/or disgust" (Halberstam 17). The film Candyman, by director Bernard ose, has much in common with Halberstam's definition of Gothic horror and monstrosity. The Candyman is a mythic urban legend that haunts the housing project Cabrini Green, located in a poor area of Chicago. The film begins just as many Gothic novels begin, with complete normalcy. The city from a distance looks normal, as does the life of Helen, a grad student studying urban legends. As Helen…… [Read More] </p>

<p> Sleepy Hollow: American Anxiety Via American Gothic The early Americans lived in an America that many are unfamiliar with in this day. Early America was a fierce wilderness rife with uncharted territories and much uncertainty. Thus, there was no doubt that early Americans felt a great deal of anxiety: anxiety about their futures and anxiety about their decision to leave England. Published in 1820, the story, "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" by ashington Irving is a classic example of American gothic fiction and is a strong representation of the anxiety of the early colonists. Many of the supernatural elements of the short story "Sleepy Hollow" demonstrate a sense of fear about what is, and a fear about the environment, along with an aggravated apprehension about what was to come. The sense of grimness and gloom is present throughout Irving's story and are tools which he uses to set the tone…… [Read More] </p>

<p> Aristotelian influence predominated together with the wisdom and learning of other ancient writers, while the former was often used as a framework for intellectual debates which readily expanded both philosophy and other areas of knowledge (Grant 127-131). The European university system was established alongside monasteries as centres for the propagation of knowledge. Scholars like Robert Grosseteste, Albertus Magnus, and Roger Bacon wrote about natural science to a growing audience. While Christianity did not recede as a dogmatic cultural system, it was not entirely determinative. Scholars could explore natural phenomena with an openness to past views, although often the learning acquired was purely rational rather than experimental, and was fused with a biblical worldview. In other words, the renaissance of the twelfth century played an integral part in transmitting scientific methodology within a predominantly religious environment that required thinkers to harmonise science with religion.

<p> She writes, "Here the slippage between animal and human invokes the Hegelian horror of slavery, a dialectic which finally reduces the master to 'brute' or a 'monster'" (Ginsberg 116). This is more than an analysis of the short story; it is an analysis of slavery and its effect on gothic literature at the time. The significance of this article is clear. It shows that Poe was not writing simply horror fiction to shock and confuse, he was writing social commentary significant to the time. It illuminates this particular work and makes it more effective, but it is also a deep looking into other slave narratives and experiences, and how they relate to Poe's writing. The author proves her point by consistently citing other works, from texts on slavery to narratives, so the overall article is extremely effective. eferences Ginsberg, Lesley.

<p> Poe's The Fall Of The House Of Usher Of all the authors to employ use of the Gothic style in their poetry or prose, none mastered the craft more than Edgar Allen Poe. The classic American fiction writer specialized in fostering a unique sense of dread and terror for his readers by successfully using elements of the Gothic genre such as the grotesque, or distorted imagery and setting, mysterious circumstances and a slowly building and suspenseful pace. The short story which best displays Poe's use of Gothic literary themes is believed by many to be The Fall of the House of Usher, his hauntingly disturbing depiction of a man's descent into madness and the consequences that unbridled fear can ultimately have. Considered to be a masterpiece of Gothic prose, Poe's The Fall of the House of Usher touches on all of the centerpieces of the genre, including perfectly chosen diction…… [Read More] </p>

<p> First, evil in Sleepy Hollow is more equating with a satirical view that, in this case, evil is a more benign humor, bumbling, caustic in disrupting the town, and, as it was in Ancient Greek and oman drama, simply more of an irritant than planned destruction. Focusing again on the time period, our first introduction to this theme is one of Dutch New York against Urban New England. The Dutch community is sylvan, nostalgically conceived, changeless, and an Eden for its inhabitants. Ichabod arrives as a Yankee whose spoiling of this Eden simply cannot be tolerated -- and even more, by marrying the daughter of a wealthy and high-ranking community member, becoming part of Eden himself. This simply could not happen to a community that is so "European in nature."

This prediction is an artifice of the poem and is not simple. "ordsworth's ability to look to the future to predict memories of events that are happening in the present is ingenious and complicated.

The same is true of the people inside. They live in a kind of living death, waiting for the end to claim them. The idea of dual life and death culminates in Roderick's sister, whose image in perceived death is one of smiling peace, almost as if still alive. The narrator's comparison of her similarity to her brother can be interpreted both literally and more supernaturally. As Roderick explains, they are twins. It is only however when he believes her to have died that the narrator makes this comparison, indicating a rather more morbid interpretation: she is dead, and he is close to it.

<p> Heart Is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers is a tale involving five main characters that struggle against the isolation and despair brought on by circumstances in their lives. The story takes place during the late 1930's in an unnamed deep Southern town. McCullers begins the story by introducing the deaf-mute John Singer; he used to live with his friend Spiros Antonapoulos who was also a deaf-mute. Singer doted on his friend a great deal even though it was apparent that Antonapoulos never showed any appreciation towards it.

<p> Magic in "The Castle of Otranto" and "The Monk" The 18th century had created one of the most popular genres in Western Literature, which is referred to as Gothic Literature. The Gothic literature genre began with the publication of Horace Walpole's novel entitled, "The Castle of Otranto" in 1765 (Gothic Experience 2003). The term "Gothic" connotes the "medieval style" that Walpole uses in his novel (Guran 1999). Elements of Gothic literature that is evident in Walpole's novel includes the elements of terror or horror, fear, strong emotions, and the pursuit of the protagonist for or against evil. "The Castle of Otranto" is a novel that focuses around the life of Manfred, Prince of Otranto, and his obsession in prolonging his power in his kingdom through his sons. Manfred's eternal pursuit for power and dominance is evident in the conflict that happens between him and the people in his castle, wherein…… [Read More] </p>

<p> Role of omen in the Dead To be sure, James Joyce's The Dead is one of the best examples of the short story in English Literature. Indeed, the artistry, depth of feeling, and acute insights into the human psyche are all on striking display in the piece. However, although many note the remarkable internal angst of Gabriel, and the role of the obvious theme of death and "the dead" throughout the story, there remains a strong theme of women, and their role as "catalyst touchstones" grounding Gabriel as well as the reader in the realization of the inevitability of suffering and death. One of the interesting aspects of interpreting any of the works of Joyce as feminist in nature, is the common criticism of Joyce's actual life. One typical example of this problem is touched on in the article "Banking on Joyce," in which he is described as despising intellectual…… [Read More] </p>

<p> Old Nurse's Story Elizabeth Gaskell's "The Old Nurse's Story" uses gothic imagery and Victorian themes to elucidate the role and status of women. Online critics claim the story is filled with themes of "male domination, females' sense of powerlessness due to this dominance, and the ambiguous results of women's struggle against males in the Victorian era," ("The Damning Effects of a Patriarchal Society in "The Old Nurse's Story" and "The Yellow allpaper"). Indeed, these three core elements are absolutely evident in this haunting tale about rediscovering personal identity via encounters with the past. The motif of haunting allows the past to return to the present in eerie ways. Relying on ghosts allows the author to present the suggestion that the past haunts the lives of all individuals, and that women have trouble extricating themselves from negative situations because of the constraints of dead social institutions and norms. However, Hughes and…… [Read More] </p>

<p> Faced with a social system that has no place for him, Tom does not rebel or repress himself, but merely creates a place for himself by dissolving into the background, becoming part of the hidden (and criminal) world that is a de facto product of any inequitable social system. As mentioned above, Highsmith wrote for a number of comic books in the 1940s, and almost all of them were concerned with white male superheroes who had been given extraordinary powers or technology. There is a subtle joke about this fact early on, when Tom notes that his most recent victim "was a comic-book artist. He probably didn't know whether he was coming or going" (Highsmith 14). Thus, almost from the beginning Highsmith has made a connection between Tom and the world of comic books, a connection that helps explain Tom's eventual narrative journey. hen looking at Tom's story in broad…… [Read More] </p>

<p> Horror What is Horror? According to Sigmund Freud, das unheimliche -- or the uncanny -- can be defined as something that is familiar and unfamiliar at the same time. In horror films, the uncanny can be achieved through the depiction of a series of events that will lead a character into a dangerous situation without the implicit description or portrayal of what the danger is. Horror is much more effective if danger and violence is left to the viewer's imagination because it is then influenced by an individual's personal fears. If a director explicitly shows danger or violence, the individual is then forced to accept the director's depiction without psychologically engaging in the suspense as much as they could have done if danger or violence was only implied. In terms of horror as a genre, the true masters of horror are the writers of Gothic literature who helped to define…… [Read More] </p>

<p> Grotesque If one goes back to Plato and examines what the Greek philosopher had to say about beauty and truth, one discovers the foundation of the transcendental spirit in the est. The Greek philosophers -- Socrates, Plato, Aristotle -- more or less constructed the philosophical lens for how to portray ideals such as unum, bonum, verum -- the one, the good and the true. Beauty was viewed from within this framework, as another aspect of the transcendental quality of goodness and truth. Plato, through his Socratic discourse, sought a way to examine and define the sense of beauty and truth from a universal and transcendent perspective, a theme that Keats would echo centuries later when he stated that "Beauty is truth, truth beauty" in his "Ode on a Grecian Urn," a Romantic Era poem. Thus, for centuries, this has been a topic that philosophers and artists have explored: How are…… [Read More] </p>

The author writes, "She taught me how to churn butter and how to make cheese. She taught me how to bake bread and to pluck a chicken, a dove, or a game bird. It should have been easy and delightful to learn such important skills. I was absolutely exhausted by it" (Gregory 507). This shows how hard the people work every day just to survive, while the royal court really has very little to do but amuse themselves. This was not a time of great industrialization and invention. England was more medieval than adventuresome during this time, and there were still knights and jousting tournaments. While England was becoming a European force, it was through wars and political maneuvering rather than in industrialization and exploration.…… [Read More] </p>

<p> Gothic/Renaissance Artifacts The Gothic and Renaissance were tumultuous periods in terms of art and architecture. These were times of wild creativity and rapid development when it came to style and subject matter. Artists and architects used not only their own minds and current cultural milieu to create their works, but gained significant depth of expression by acknowledging the traditions of the past. These were used to mold new ideas and new ways of art in a way that was unprecedented at the time. Two examples of this kind of development are Nicola Pisano's marble pulpit of the Pisa Cathedral and Hieronymus osch's "The Last Judgment."

This makes it difficult for them to enjoy the simple pleasures in life, considering that they waste most of their time trying to put across ideas that are appealing to the masses. While many did not manage to produce ideas that survived more than them, others succeeded and actually produced thinking that remained in society for a long period of time consequent to their death. Creativity is generally regarded as one of the most important concepts in society, considering that it generally induces intense feelings in individuals.

<p> English Literature The medieval period in English history spans across some 800 years. The Anglo-Saxon period consisted of literature that was retained in memory. The major influence of the literature up until the Norman Conquest was mainly of the religious kind. "Distinguished, highly literate churchmen (Abrams 4) the Ecclesiastical History of England remains our "most important source of knowledge about the Anglo-Saxon period" (4). The Anglo-Saxons were primarily known for their contribution to poetry. Their alliterative form was, of course, how poetry survived. Sine they wrote nothing down until they were "Christianized," Abrams suggest that that Christian ideals influenced how things were recorded and it would also explain why some non-Christian literature did not survive. Beowulf is what Abrams refers to as the "greatest" German epic, even though it appears to many pre-Christian ideas.

<p> Poe, Fall of the House of Usher Edgar Allan Poe's "The Fall of the House of Usher" is perhaps the best-known American entry into the genre of Romantic and Gothic tale, yet it is worth asking what elements actually identify it as such. Spitzer describes the level of Gothic excess here: Roderick and Madeline, twins chained to each other by incestuous love, suffering separately but dying together, represent the male and the female principle in that decaying family whose members, by the law of sterility and destruction which rules them, must exterminate each other; Roderick has buried his sister alive, but the revived Madeline will bury Roderick under her falling body. The "fall" of the House of Usher involves not only the physical fall of the mansion, but the physical and moral fall of the two protagonists. (Spitzer 352).

Nettie, the Stark matriarch, is described watching this stranger wash, "his naked shoulders, the gleam of his skin, and the lines of charred bronze where the sun had burned his neck and wrists, the faint red-gold of the hairs that edged from under his belt at his waist" (Lane, p. 144).

<p> All without distinction were branded as fanatics and phantasts; not only those, whose wild and exorbitant imaginations had actually engendered only extravagant and grotesque phantasms, and whose productions were, for the most part, poor copies and gross caricatures of genuine inspiration; but the truly inspired likewise, the originals themselves. And this for no other reason, but because they were the unlearned, men of humble and obscure occupations. (Coleridge iographia IX) To a certain extent, Coleridge's polemical point here is consistent with his early radical politics, and his emergence from the lively intellectual community of London's "dissenting academies" at a time when religious non-conformists (like the Unitarian Coleridge) were not permitted to attend Oxford or Cambridge: he is correct that science and philosophy were more active among "humble and obscure" persons, like Joseph Priestley or Anna Letitia arbauld, who had emerged from the dissenting academies because barred (by religion or gender)…… [Read More] </p>
<p> By mid-century, however, these forces in the use of grotesque in prose were fully integrated as a matter of style. We can contrast two convenient examples from mid-century England, in Dickens's 1850 novel David Copperfield, compared with Carlyle's notorious essay originally published in 1849 under the title "Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question." Dickens is, of course, the great master of the grotesque in the Victorian novel. Most of Dickens' villains -- the villainous dwarf Quilp in The Old Curiosity Shop, the hunchback Flintwinch in Little Dorrit, the junkshop-proprietor Krook who perishes of spontaneous combustion in Bleak House -- have names and physical characteristics that signpost them as near-perfect examples of the grotesque. The notion that this grotesquerie is, in some way, related to the streak of social criticism in Dickens' fiction is somewhat attractive, because even the social problems in these novels are configured in ways that recall the grotesque, like the Circumlocution Office in Little Dorrit, Boffin's mammoth dust-heap in Our Mutual Friend, or the philanthropist and negligent mother Mrs. Jellaby in Bleak House who proves Dickens' polemical point about charity beginning at home by being rather grotesquely eaten by the cannibals of Borrioboola-Gha. We can see Dickens' grotesque in a less outlandish form, but still recognizable as grotesque, in the introduction of the villainous Uriah Heep in Chapter 15 of David Copperfield: When the pony-chaise stopped at the door, and my eyes were intent upon the house, I saw a cadaverous face appear at a small window on the ground floor (in a little round tower that formed one side of the house), and quickly disappear. The low arched door then opened, and the face came out. It was quite as cadaverous as it had looked in the window, though in the grain of it there was that tinge of red which is sometimes to be observed in the skins of red-haired people. It belonged to a red-haired person -- a youth of fifteen, as I take it now, but looking much older -- whose hair was cropped as close as the closest stubble; who had hardly any eyebrows, and no eyelashes, and eyes of a red-brown, so unsheltered and unshaded, that I remember wondering how he went to sleep. He was high-shouldered and bony; dressed in decent black, with a white wisp of a neckcloth; buttoned up to the throat; and had a long, lank, skeleton hand, which particularly attracted my attention, as he stood at the pony's head, rubbing his chin with it, and looking up at us in the chaise.

<p> (Eliot, 1971). The Subjective over the Objective Modernism was a reaction against Realism and its focus on objective depiction of life as it was actually lived. Modernist writers derived little artistic pleasure from describing the concrete details of the material world and the various human doings in it. They derived only a little more pleasure from describing the thoughts of those humans inhabiting the material world. Their greatest pleasure, however, was in expressing the angst, confusion, and frustration of the individual who has to live in that world. (Merriam-Webster, p. 1236). Modernist writers used novel means for expressing these newly intense emotions. They did not always express the individual's confusion and frustration by relating the inner discourse of the individual. Instead, they manipulated the structure, style, and content of their works to cultivate a certain effect on the reader. (aym, Vol. D, p. 17). They wanted to convey the experience…… [Read More] </p>

The characters experience helplessness and terror in the face of the forces of beyond, rather than any sense of empowerment that they can control them with science. Morality, rather than reason enables them to survive. The realism that alpole perceives in his narrative is the morality that the characters struggle with, in attempting to do the 'correct' thing.

In the essay, she discussed the parallelisms between the Mary Shelley and the character of Victor Frankenstein, which she both considered as "creators." One parallelism that stands out in the lives of Shelley and Frankenstein is their being both creators and destructors of human life. The 'creator's dilemma' is when Shelley and Frankenstein experienced giving "birth" to life while also being responsible for its death upon its birth. This argument presented by Moers is given central focus in this paper.

And such a soul is weighed down by this and is dragged back into the visible world, through fear of the invisible and of the other world, and so, as they say, it flits about the monuments and the tombs, where shadowy shapes of souls have been seen, figures of those souls which were not…… [Read More] </p>

The narrator looks for logical ways to explain what occurs in the home and he also wishes to find out the reason behind Roderick's agitation. Interestingly, Roderick believes the house is the source of all of his tension, yet he rarely leaves the house. The image of the house sinking dramatizes Roderick's sinking state of mind.

<p> Edgar Allen Poe is one of the most famous American authors, but many of his works are not explicitly about the American experience. His "gothic" fiction is filled with suspense, the macabre, the grotesque, and the dark side of human nature. However, a deeper analysis of Poe's works can reveal parallels between his fiction and the American experience. One of Poe's works that can particularly symbolize and exemplify the American experience is his short story "The Fall of the House of Usher." While Poe may not have intended the symbolism and motifs in "The Fall of the House of Usher" to represent the American experience, there are several elements in the story that show that the author was at least on some level aware of the connection. In several ways, Edgar Allen Poe's "The Fall of the House of Usher" is a parable of the American experience because the author…… [Read More] </p>

<p> SYMBOLIC THEMES OF MYSTERY AND THE SUPERNATURAL IN SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDE'S RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER In Samuel Taylor Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner," considered by many scholars as the quintessential masterpiece of English Romantic poetry, the symbolic themes of mystery and the supernatural play a very crucial role in the poem's overall effect which John Hill Spencer sees as Coleridge's "attempt to understand the mystery surrounding the human soul in a universe moved by forces and powers... immanent and transcendent" (157). Yet the Mariner himself appears to be trapped in this supernatural world as a result of ghostly manifestations which emanate from the realms of the unknown. The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" was first published in Lyrical Ballads in 1798, a collection of poetry written and published jointly by Coleridge and his good friend William Wordsworth. Yet the text of the poem generally in use today appeared…… [Read More] </p>

<p> Giaour is cursed to be a vampire as punishment, while Ruthven seems to revel in the power and the role this gives him. He also describes women as adulteresses and worse and treats them as fodder for his needs on every level. Aubrey notes this and does not like it, but he also does not manage to escape from the man or his way of life. In the end, his own sister is destroyed by this man, just as was Ianthe and countless others. Of course, Giaour also indulges in illicit sex with Leila, certainly illicit in the Muslim social order, though it would be in Europe as well. Leila's relationship with Hassan would also be seen as illicit in Europe, though, which is why Byron makes the point of noting that this sort of arrangement was more common in the past than it is in his own time.

<p> Fall of the House of Usher Although Poe's "The Fall of the House of Usher" is a work of gothic horror, it is worth noting that the story's meaning is constructed in part by the use of puns. I do not use the word "pun" to refer to a joking play on words, but rather on the conscious use of a word that plays upon two potential meanings: the effect is rhetorical rather than humorous. The first of these puns is obvious and is contained in the title: E. Arthur Robinson notes the double meaning whereby "the House of the title refers both to Usher's lineage and to his ancestral home" (Robinson 69). In other words, Roderick Usher's death is the end of the "House of Usher" -- his family bloodline -- but it is also marked, terrifyingly, by the literal collapse of an edifice.

<p> One cannot build the right sort of house -- the houses are not really adequate, "Blinds, shutter, curtains, awnings, were all closed and drawn to keep out the star. Grant it but a chink or keyhole, and it shot in like a white-hot arrow." The stare here is the metonymic device -- we assume it is stranger, the outside vs. The inside, but for some reason, it is also the authority involved, and one that is able to ensure adequacy. In a similar vein, the "churches were freest from it," but they offer only an homage' to safety, and use their power to shut people out from the light that "made the eyes ache" and had been inhumanly oppressive. The prison, though, is "so repulsive a place that even the obtrusive star blinked at it and left it to such refuse of reflected light as could find." The stare is…… [Read More] </p>

<p> age and several thousand miles separated Russian Alexander Pushkin and American Flannery O'Connor. This essay seeks to illustrate why they deserve to be considered as icons of world literature. Pushkin's body of works spans poetry -- romantic and political, essays, and novels. Influential music composers like Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Rimsky Korsakov and Tchaikovsky adapted the lyrical and dramatic elements of Pushkin's works. Flannery O'Connor's work, on the other hand, was largely restricted to short stories. The profundity of her work lies in its uniqueness -- not volume. Her stories hide gruesomeness, truth and religious thought that is not immediately obvious at a superficial level. The short-story "The Queen of Spades," while not necessarily representative of all of Pushkin's work gives us an idea of the narrative skills that keep the reader on edge.

The horrible marionette, in contrast, rather than singing, smoked its cigarette and tried to pretend it was alive. Finally, the utter hopelessness of the dark side of Victorian society comes out with the phrase, "The dead are dancing with the dead, the dust is whirling with the dust," evoking the funeral speak of "ashes to ashes, dust to dust," and the dead -- the underside of society, those with whom the proper Victorian had little use, pass from love to lust, from light to dark, tire of the game as they do the synthetic waltz, their shadows morphing into nothing as they continue to wheel and whirl, finally weary of it all.

<p> The Gothic Novel (1764-1820) </p>
<p> Features of the Gothic Novel </p>
<p> The term Gothic is used relating to Gothic architecture, sculpture or painting of the 12th to 16th century in Western Europe. Being associated with medieval times, Gothic has come to signify novels which have, what is thought to be a typical medieval setting: omens, gloomy or enchanted castles or monasteries, trap doors, dungeons, haunted ruins and secret passages. The characters are typified; dialogues and the characters' reactions are full of platitudes and clichés. Often there is a virtuous protagonist opposed to one or more villains, or a mysterious character whose secret past is revealed. The plot is embedded into an atmosphere of mystery and chilling terror. </p>
<p> Examples of the Typical Gothic Novel </p>
<p> HORACE WALPOLE, The Castle of Otranto (1764), </p>
<p> ANNE RADCLIFFE, The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794), </p>
<p> CHARLES ROBERT MATURIN, Melmoth the Wanderer (1820). </p>
<p> The following passage gives an impression of the kind of horror evoked by a Gothic narration: </p>
<p> “As the moon was now at its height, he read in the countenances of this unhappy company the event he dreaded. 'What! Is she dead?' Cried he in wild confusion – A clap of thunder at that instant shook the castle to its foundations; the earth rocked, and the clank of more than mortal armour was heard behind. Frederic and Jerome thought the last day was at hand. The latter, forcing Theodore along with them, rushed into the court. The moment Theodore appeared, the walls of the castle behind Manfred were thrown down with a mighty force, and the form of Alfonso, dilated to an immense magnitude, appeared in the centre of the ruins. 'Behold in Theodore, the true heir of Alfonso!' said the vision: and having pronounced those words, accompanied by a clap of thunder, it ascended solemnly towards heaven, where the clouds parting asunder, the form of Saint Nicholas was seen; and receiving Alfonso's shade, they were soon wrapped from mortal eyes in a blaze of glory.” (Horace Walpole, The Castle of Otranto, final scene) </p>
<p> Varieties of the Gothic Novel </p>
<p> Gothic in the broader sense has been applied to narratives which, though lacking the medieval setting, create an atmosphere of gloom and terror: </p>
<p> MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT SHELLEY, Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus (1817); </p>
<p> EDGAR ALLAN POE, Tales of Mystery and Imagination (1839-46); </p>
<p> ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886); </p>
<p> or which display Gothic stock devices, e.g. mistaken or double identity, guilt, suspense and horror: </p>
<p> e. g. the presentation of Miss Havisham in CHARLES DICKENS, Great Expectations (1861); </p>
<p> CHARLES DICKENS, Bleak House (1852–53); </p>
<p> ISAK DINESEN, Seven Gothic Tales (1934); </p>
<p> STEPHEN KING's Carrie (1974) and Insomnia (1994) are examples of modern horror fiction; </p>
<p> ROALD DAHL's Kiss Kiss (1959) uses elements of the macabre; </p>
<p> CHARLOTTE BRONTË's Jane Eyre (1847) and EMILY BRONTË's Wuthering Heights (1847) are gothic romances; </p>
<p> JANE AUSTEN's Northanger Abbey (1803/1818) ridicules gothic literature by contrasting it with real life; the heroine imagines herself living in a gothic setting. </p>
<p> MARY W. SHELLEY's </p>
<p> Frankenstein MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT SHELLEY's Frankenstein is the incredible story of Victor Frankenstein, a Genevan student of science, who learns the secret of making dead material come alive. By constructing a creature, which is near-human, out of parts of dead bodies, he enters into the Faustian Pact (the thirst for knowledge which is followed by punishment): his ambition later turns on him, when the creature he has created runs out of control. Its monster-like appearance casts it into an outsider role. Out of hatred, it kills its creator, his brother and his bride. Frankenstein can also be considered the first Science Fiction novel, as it deals with one of the basic themes of Science Fiction: man aims at outdoing nature and later meets with retribution. </p>

<p> Gothic novel </p>
<p> Gothic novel, European Romantic, pseudomedieval fiction having a prevailing atmosphere of mystery and terror. Its heyday was the 1790s, but it underwent frequent revivals in subsequent centuries. </p>
<p> Called Gothic because its imaginative impulse was drawn from medieval buildings and ruins, such novels commonly used such settings as castles or monasteries equipped with subterranean passages, dark battlements, hidden panels, and trapdoors. The vogue was initiated in England by Horace Walpole’s immensely successful Castle of Otranto (1765). His most respectable follower was Ann Radcliffe, whose Mysteries of Udolpho (1794) and Italian (1797) are among the best examples of the genre. A more sensational type of Gothic romance exploiting horror and violence flourished in Germany and was introduced to England by Matthew Gregory Lewis with The Monk (1796). Other landmarks of Gothic fiction are William Beckford’s Oriental romance Vathek (1786) and Charles Robert Maturin’s story of an Irish Faust, Melmoth the Wanderer (1820). The classic horror stories Frankenstein (1818), by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, and Dracula (1897), by Bram Stoker, are in the Gothic tradition but introduce the existential nature of humankind as its definitive mystery and terror. </p>
<p> Easy targets for satire, the early Gothic romances died of their own extravagances of plot, but Gothic atmospheric machinery continued to haunt the fiction of such major writers as the Brontë sisters, Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and even Dickens in Bleak House and Great Expectations. In the second half of the 20th century, the term was applied to paperback romances having the same kind of themes and trappings similar to the originals. </p>

<p> Gothic: Four Hundred Years of Excess, Horror, Evil and Ruin (1999) is the best introduction the genre, linking it with the modern day gothic sensibility. </p>
<p> The rise of fantastic fiction in France parallels the rise of the gothic novel in England. [Jun 2006] </p>
<p> Every European country had its own terminology to denote the sensibility of the gothic novel. In France it was called the roman noir ("black novel", now primarily used to denote the hardboiled detective genre) and in Germany it was called the Schauerroman ("shudder novel"). Italy and Spain must have had their own, but I am unaware of their names as of yet. In nineteenth century France there also flourished a literature of horror on a par with the English Gothic novel or the German Schauerroman. It was christened 'le roman frénétique'. </p>

<p> Charles Dickens (1812-1870) loved the style of 18th century gothic novel, though it had already become a bit of a joke—Jane Austen’s Northanger Abbey being a well known parody—and whilst some are grotesques their eccentricities do not usually overshadow the stories. [Nov 2005] </p>
<p> Definition </p>
<p> Prominent features of many gothic novels are mystery, doom, decay, old buildings with ghosts in them, madness, hereditary curses and so on. </p>
<p> In England, the Gothic novel as a genre had largely played itself out by 1840. It left a lasting legacy, however, in works such as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and the works of Edgar Allan Poe. From these, the Gothic genre strictly considered gave way to modern horror fiction. </p>
<p> Gothic novel </p>
<p> The gothic novel, of the early nineteenth century, was responsible above all else for the term gothic being associated with a mood of horror, darkness and the supernatural. They established what horror stereotypes became by featuring graveyards, ruined castles or churches, ghosts, vampires, cursed families, and melodramatic plots. A notable element in these novels were the brooding figure of the gothic villain, which developed into the Byronic hero, a key precursor in the male goth image. The most famous gothic villain of this genre would be Dracula. In 1993 Whitby became the location for what became the UK's biggest goth festival as a direct result of featuring in Stoker's Dracula. </p>
<p> The work of Edgar Allan Poe, master of the gothic short story, has also been an inspiration for many goths. Also, the modern figure of the femme fatale, which has its roots in Romantic literature, is a key image for female goths. </p>

<p> Ann Radcliffe and Salvator Rosa </p>
<p> Landscape with Tobias and the Angel (ca. 1660-73) - Salvator Rosa </p>
<p> Ann Radcliffe was greatly influenced by the Italian landscape painter, Salvator Rosa. Where Rosa applied brush strokes, Radcliffe wove words. </p>
<p> Salvator Rosa (1615-73), 17th century Italian landscape painter, created dramatic landscapes peopled with peasants and banditti. Like the works of Ann Radcliffe, who he heavily influenced, Rosa intended to create a feeling of awe and the sublime in the minds of his audience. The works of Rosa, together with those of less dramatic landscape artists, Claude Lorraine (1600-82), Gaspard Poussin (1615-75), Domenico Zampieri (1581-1641), were very popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. The landscapes of the Italian artist and architect Domenico Zampieri greatly influenced those of Claude and Poussin. All receive mention in the novels of Ann Radcliffe. --http://www.heureka.clara.net/art/radcliff.htm [Jun 2005] </p>
<p> European Gothic: A Spirited Exchange 1760-1960 (2002) - Avril Horner (editor) </p>
<p> "European Gothic: A Spirited Exchange 1760-1960 sets out to challenge the tyranny of the Anglo-American narratives that have dominated critical histories of the Gothic so far. It argues that the Gothic novel did not simply derive from "The Castle of Otranto, but that it has been forged in the crucible of translation. Focussing on Gothic writing in English, French, German, Russian and Spanish, the collection charts a rich process of cross-fertilization and, in particular, examines the importance of Anglo-French exchanges in the development of the Gothic novel within Europe and, subsequently, the US. Within this framework, and from a variety of critical perspectives, the 13 contributors re-assess the work of authors such as Clara Reeve, Sophia Lee, Charlotte Smith, Ann Radcliffe, Matthew Lewis, Charles Maturin, Coleridge, Mary Shelley, Jan Potocki, Balzac, Dostoevsky, Gaston Leroux and Djuna Barnes. The volume thus offers a fresh way of thinking about Gothic lineages and histories. --from the publisher </p>
<p> The Gothic Flame (1957) - Devendra P. Varma </p>
<p> This book was published at a time when the only sources for the gothic sensibility in literature were Mario Praz's Italian Romantic Agony (1930) and for cinema the French film magazine Midi-Minuit Fantastique (1962 - 1971). </p>
<p> An excerpt of the Gothic Flame on Anne Radcliffe and the difference between terror and horror via here. </p>
<p> Mrs. Radcliffe, a mistress of hints, associations, silence, and emptiness, only half-revealing her picture leaves the rest to the imagination. She knows, as Burke has asserted, that obscurity is a strong ingredient in the sublime; but she knew the sharp distinction between Terror and Horror, which was unknown to Burke. "Terror and horror...are so far opposite, that the first expands the soul, and awakens the faculties to a high degree of life; the other contracts, freezes and nearly annihilates them...; and where lies the great difference between terror and horror, but in the uncertainty and obscurity, that accompany the first, respecting the dreaded evil?" Sounds unexplained, sights indistinctly caught, dim shadows endowed with motion by the flicker of the firelight or the shimmer of the moonbeam invoke superstitious fear. "To the warm imagination," she writes in The Mysteries of Udolpho, "the forms which float half-veiled in darkness afford a higher delight than the most distinct scenery the Sun can show." </p>
<p> The chords of terror which had tremulously shuddered beneath Mrs. Radcliffe's gentle fingers were now smitten with a new vehemence. The intense school of the Schauer- Romantiks improvised furious and violent themes in the orchestra of horror.... The contrast between the work and personalities of Mrs. Radcliffe and ' Monk' Lewis serves to illustrate the two distinct streams of the Gothic novel: the former representing the Craft of Terror, the latter and his followers comprising the chambers of Horror.... </p>
<p> The difference between Terror and Horror is the difference between awful apprehension and sickening realization: between the smell of death and stumbling against a corpse. Professor McKillop, quoting from Mrs. Radcliffe, said that " obscurity [in Terror] . . . leaves the imagination to act on a few hints that truth reveals to it, . . . obscurity leaves something for the imagination to exaggerate". Burke held that "To make anything very terrible, obscurity seems in general to be necessary", and added that, ". . . darkness, being originally an idea of terror, was chosen as a fit scene for such terrible representations ". Burke did not distinguish between the subtle gradations of Terror and Horror; he related only Terror to Beauty, and probably did not conceive of the beauty of the Horrid, the grotesque power of something ghastly, too vividly imprinted on the mind and sense. </p>
<p> Terror thus creates an intangible atmosphere of spiritual psychic dread, a certain superstitious shudder at the other world. Horror resorts to a cruder presentation of the macabre: by an exact portrayal of the physically horrible and revolting, against a far more terrible background of spiritual gloom and despair. Horror appeals to sheer dread and repulsion, by brooding upon the gloomy and the sinister, and lacerates the nerves by establishing actual cutaneous contact with the supernatural... </p>
<p> Each writer of the intense school contributed a grotesque and gruesome theme of horror to the Schauer-Romantik phase of the Gothic novel. They wrote stories of black-magic and lust, of persons in pursuit of the elixir virtue, of insatiable curiosity and unpardonable sins, of contracts with the Devil, of those who manufacture monsters in their laboratories, tales of skull-headed ladies, of the dead arising from their graves to feed upon the blood of the innocent and beautiful, or who walk about in the Hall of Eblis, carrying their burning hearts in their hands.... The baleful hall of Eblis, "the abode of ve ngeance and despair", is pictured in the full effulgence of infernal majesty. It conveys to us the horror of the most ghastly convulsions and screams that may not be smothered. Here everyone carries within him a heart tormented in flames, to wander in an eternity of unabating anguish... </p>
<p> Three Gothic Novels: The Castle of Otranto; Vathek; Frankenstein (1968) - Various </p>
<p> The Gothic novel, which flourished from about 1765 until 1825, revels in the horrible and the supernatural, in suspense and exotic settings. This volume presents three of the most celebrated Gothic novels: "The Castle of Otranto", published pseudonymously in 1765; "Vathek" (1786); and the story of "Frankenstein" (1818). Introduction by Mario Praz. The cover image of this Penguin edition illustrates one of the main tropes of gothic fiction: the isolated and haunted castle. </p>

<p> Francesca M. Marinaro has a PhD in English from the University of Florida and has been teaching English composition and Literature since 2007. </p>
<p> In this lesson, we'll look at the rise of the Gothic novel and its popularity, identify some of the major characteristics and themes of the gothic, and discuss a few examples from classic literature. </p>
<p> Gothic Novels: Background and Origin </p>
<p> 'It was a dark and stormy night…' We all love a good ghost story or horror film, and these forms of entertainment share some characteristics with the Gothic literature genre, like ghosts, ghouls, and headless spirits that may haunt the main characters. </p>
<p> Gothic literature has a long history dating back to the 18th century. Credited as the first Gothic novel and considered one of the founding texts of the genre is Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, published in 1764. It tells the story of Lord Manfred and the family curse that seems to arise when a stone helmet falls on his son and kills him on the day he is to be married. The event seems to awaken a mysterious trend of curses and mishaps that send the characters in the novel into complete disarray. </p>
<p> Other famous examples of Gothic literature include The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Dracula. Since the Gothic novel has branched off into numerous sub-genres, this lesson will look primarily at the origin of the Gothic in English literature and overview some of the classic texts that created the building blocks for what we know as Gothic today. </p>
<p> Characteristics of the Gothic Novel </p>
<p> The term Gothic novel broadly refers to stories that combine elements from horror and romanticism. The Gothic novel often deals with supernatural events, or events occurring in nature that cannot be easily explained or over which man has no control, and it typically follows a plot of suspense and mystery. </p>
<p> Here is a list of some common elements found in Gothic novels: </p>
<p> Gloomy, decaying setting (haunted houses or castles with secret passages, trapdoors, and other mysterious architecture) </p>
<p> Supernatural beings or monsters (ghosts, vampires, zombies, giants) </p>
<p> Damsels in distress </p>
<p> Heroes </p>
<p> Romance </p>
<p> We'll look at a few characteristics - the supernatural, madness, and romance - in more detail in the following paragraphs, along with classic examples. </p>
<p> The Supernatural </p>
<p> The Gothic novel arose in part out of the fact that for the English, the late 18th and 19th centuries were a time of great discovery and exploration in the fields of science, religion, and industry; people both revered and questioned the existence of God or a higher power. Gothic novels allowed writers and readers to explore these ideas through the medium of storytelling. Ghosts, death and decay, madness, curses, and so-called 'things that go bump in the night' provided ways to explore fear of the unknown and what control we have as humans over the unknown. </p>
<p> Mary Shelley's classic tale Frankenstein, first published in 1818, offers a powerful example of this desire to explore the unknown even as we fear it. Frankenstein's monster is a man-made creation that eerily merges life and death; Frankenstein constructs his creation from human body parts and imbues him with life, which at once gives him great power and a great fear of that power because he realizes that he's created a being that he cannot entirely control. His fear of his own creation emerges from his recognition that he cannot ever fully understand or control the forces of life and death, despite all of his scientific knowledge. </p>
<p> Madness </p>
<p> The Gothic can also refer to stories involving strange and troubling events that, while they have logical, natural explanations, seem to originate from unexpected forces. Charlotte Bronte employs this element of the Gothic in Jane Eyre, published in 1847. While living in Thornfield Hall as a governess, Jane frequently hears strange noises and laughter coming from the third story of the mansion that no one will explain, and odd things keep happening in the dead of night, such as her master Mr. Rochester's bed catching fire and an attack on a guest. Eventually Jane discovers that all of this is the work of Mr. Rochester's insane wife, who he's hiding in an attic in the third story and who sneaks out at night to cause mayhem. </p>

<p> Madness is a common theme in the Gothic novel. While we have greater clinical understanding of the term now, 19th century doctors were only just beginning to really study the condition in-depth. Madness in the Gothic novel serves both to create suspense for the reader and to explore aspects of human nature that cannot be easily understood. Mrs. Rochester's mad behavior might be logically explained by her condition, but the mystery surrounding that condition creates elements of fear, danger, and helplessness in the face of the unknown. </p>
<p> Romance </p>
<p> Another common characteristic of the Gothic novel is romance. The romance in the Gothic novel is usually set against the background of the mysterious circumstances of the plot; Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794) is a classic tale of the damsel in distress trapped in a spooky castle and forced to marry an evil villain until the handsome lover comes to her rescue. Gothic novels explore the power of love not just as a feeling, but a force of nature unto itself: beautiful because of its ability to draw people together and terrifying in the actions it compels people to commit for their desires. Love is, in the Gothic novel, almost a supernatural force, unable to be contained by those who experience it. </p>
<p> A classic example of the power of love in the Gothic novel can be found in Emily Bronte's 1846 novel Wuthering Heights. Cathy and Heathcliff, two of the most famous star-crossed lovers next to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, desire one another so powerfully that nothing, not even death, seems able to keep them apart. When Heathcliff runs away because Cathy decides to marry the rich Edgar Linton rather than stay with Heathcliff and live in poverty, she realizes that she's driven him away and experiences a fit of madness. </p>
<p> When she dies, her spirit haunts Wuthering Heights, her girlhood home, where Heathcliff returns to live, and his own mysterious death is suggestively caused in part by Cathy. He's found dead with no apparent marks of violence and no determined cause of death, but he had told the housekeeper, Nelly, that Cathy had been coming to him and he had been dreaming of her. At the end of the novel, the village people swear that the ghosts of Cathy and Heathcliff wander the moors at night. Bronte's novel offers a cautionary tale about the self-destructive power of love and a story about the ability of love to transcend even death. </p>

<p> Decorative panel showing the two separable elements of Grotesque: the elaborate acanthus leaf and candelabra type design and the hideous mask or face </p>
<p> Since at least the 18th century (in French and German as well as English), grotesque has come to be used as a general adjective for the strange, mysterious, magnificent, fantastic, hideous, ugly, incongruous, unpleasant, or disgusting, and thus is often used to describe weird shapes and distorted forms such as Halloween masks. In art, performance, and literature, however, grotesque may also refer to something that simultaneously invokes in an audience a feeling of uncomfortable bizarreness as well as sympathetic pity. More specifically, the grotesque forms on Gothic buildings, when not used as drain-spouts, should not be called gargoyles, but rather referred to simply as grotesques, or chimeras.[1] </p>
<p> The English word first appears in the 1560s as a noun borrowed from French, and comes originally from the Italian grottesca (literally "of a cave" from the Italian grotta, 'cave'; see grotto),[2] an extravagant style of ancient Roman decorative art rediscovered at Rome at the end of the fifteenth century and subsequently imitated. The word was first used of paintings found on the walls of basements of ruins in Rome that were called at that time le Grotte ('the caves'). These 'caves' were in fact rooms and corridors of the Domus Aurea, the unfinished palace complex started by Nero after the Great Fire of Rome in CE 64, which had become overgrown and buried, until they were broken into again, mostly from above. Spreading from Italian to the other European languages, the term was long used largely interchangeably with arabesque and moresque for types of decorative patterns using curving foliage elements. </p>
<p> Rémi Astruc has argued that although there is an immense variety of motifs and figures, the three main tropes of the grotesque are doubleness, hybridity and metamorphosis.[3] Beyond the current understanding of the grotesque as an aesthetic category, he demonstrated how the grotesque functions as a fundamental existential experience. Moreover, Astruc identifies the grotesque as a crucial, and potentially universal, anthropological device that societies have used to conceptualize alterity and change.[not verified in body] </p>
<p> In art, grotesques are ornamental arrangements of arabesques with interlaced garlands and small and fantastic human and animal figures, usually set out in a symmetrical pattern around some form of architectural framework, though this may be very flimsy. Such designs were fashionable in ancient Rome, especially as fresco wall decoration and floor mosaic. Stylized versions, common in Imperial Roman decoration, were decried by Vitruvius (c. 30 BC) who, in dismissing them as meaningless and illogical, offered the following description: </p>
<p> For example, reeds are substituted for columns, fluted appendages with curly leaves and volutes take the place of pediments, candelabra support representations of shrines, and on top of their roofs grow slender stalks and volutes with human figures senselessly seated upon them.[4] </p>
<p> When Nero's palace in Rome, the Domus Aurea, was inadvertently rediscovered in the late 15th century, buried in fifteen hundred years of fill, the first breakthrough was from above, so that those keen to see the rooms had to be lowered down into them on ropes, completing their resemblance to caves, grotte in Italian. The Roman wall decorations in fresco and delicate stucco were a revelation. </p>
<p> The first appearance of the word grottesche appears in a contract of 1502 for the Piccolomini Library attached to the duomo of Siena. They were introduced by Raphael Sanzio and his team of decorative painters, who developed grottesche into a complete system of ornament in the Loggias that are part of the series of Raphael's Rooms in the Vatican Palace, Rome. "The decorations astonished and charmed a generation of artists that was familiar with the grammar of the classical orders but had not guessed till then that in their private houses the Romans had often disregarded those rules and had adopted instead a more fanciful and informal style that was all lightness, elegance and grace."[5] In these grotesque decorations a tablet or candelabrum might provide a focus; frames were extended into scrolls that formed part of the surrounding designs as a kind of scaffold, as Peter Ward-Jackson noted. Light scrolling grotesques could be ordered by confining them within the framing of a pilaster to give them more structure. Giovanni da Udine took up the theme of grotesques in decorating the Villa Madama, the most influential of the new Roman villas. </p>
<p> Maiolica pilgrim bottle with grottesche decor, Fontana workshop, Urbino, c 1560-70 </p>
<p> In the 16th century, such artistic license and irrationality was controversial matter. Francisco de Holanda puts a defense in the mouth of Michelangelo in his third dialogue of Da Pintura Antiga, 1548: </p>
<p> "this insatiable desire of man sometimes prefers to an ordinary building, with its pillars and doors, one falsely constructed in grotesque style, with pillars formed of children growing out of stalks of flowers, with architraves and cornices of branches of myrtle and doorways of reeds and other things, all seeming impossible and contrary to reason, yet it may be really great work if it is performed by a skillful artist."[6] </p>
<p> The delight of Mannerist artists and their patrons in arcane iconographic programs available only to the erudite could be embodied in schemes of grottesche,[7] Andrea Alciato's Emblemata (1522) offered ready-made iconographic shorthand for vignettes. More familiar material for grotesques could be drawn from Ovid's Metamorphoses.[8] </p>
<p> The Vatican loggias, a loggia corridor space in the Apostolic Palace open to the elements on one side, were decorated around 1519 by Raphaels's large team of artists, with Giovanni da Udine the main hand involved. Because of the relative unimportance of the space, and a desire to copy the Domus Aurea style, no large paintings were used, and the surfaces were mostly covered with grotesque designs on a white background, with paintings imitating sculptures in niches, and small figurative subjects in a revival of Ancient Roman style. This large array provided a repertoire of elements that were the basis for later artists across Europe.[9] </p>
<p> In Michelangelo's Medici Chapel Giovanni da Udine composed during 1532-33 "most beautiful sprays of foliage, rosettes and other ornaments in stucco and gold" in the coffers and "sprays of foliage, birds, masks and figures", with a result that did not please Pope Clement VII Medici, however, nor Giorgio Vasari, who whitewashed the grottesche decor in 1556.[10] Counter Reformation writers on the arts, notably Cardinal Gabriele Paleotti, bishop of Bologna,[11] turned upon grottesche with a righteous vengeance.[12] </p>
<p> Vasari, echoing Vitruvius, described the style as follows:[9] </p>
<p> "Grotesques are a type of extremely licentious and absurd painting done by the ancients ... without any logic, so that a weight is attached to a thin thread which could not support it, a horse is given legs made of leaves, a man has crane's legs, with countless other impossible absurdities; and the bizarrer the painter's imagination, the higher he was rated". </p>
<p> Engravings, woodwork, book illustration, decorations[edit] </p>
<p> In the meantime, through the medium of engravings the grotesque mode of surface ornament passed into the European artistic repertory of the 16th century, from Spain to Poland. A classic suite was that attributed to Enea Vico, published in 1540-41 under an evocative explanatory title, Leviores et extemporaneae picturae quas grotteschas vulgo vocant, "Light and extemporaneous pictures that are vulgarly called grotesques". Later Mannerist versions, especially in engraving, tended to lose that initial lightness and be much more densely filled than the airy well-spaced style used by the Romans and Raphael. </p>
<p> Soon grottesche appeared in marquetry (fine woodwork), in maiolica produced above all at Urbino from the late 1520s, then in book illustration and in other decorative uses. At Fontainebleau Rosso Fiorentino and his team enriched the vocabulary of grotesques by combining them with the decorative form of strapwork, the portrayal of leather straps in plaster or wood moldings, which forms an element in grotesques. </p>
<p> Grotesque made of gold thread on saddle pad, dated from 1600-1650. </p>
<p> In the 17th and 18th centuries the grotesque encompasses a wide field of teratology (science of monsters) and artistic experimentation. The monstrous, for instance, often occurs as the notion of play. The sportiveness of the grotesque category can be seen in the notion of the preternatural category of the lusus naturae, in natural history writings and in cabinets of curiosities.[15][16] The last vestiges of romance, such as the marvellous also provide opportunities for the presentation of the grotesque in, for instance, operatic spectacle. The mixed form of the novel was commonly described as grotesque - see for instance Fielding's "comic epic poem in prose". (Joseph Andrews and Tom Jones) </p>
<p> Grotesque ornament received a further impetus from new discoveries of original Roman frescoes and stucchi at Pompeii and the other buried sites round Mount Vesuvius from the middle of the century. It continued in use, becoming increasingly heavy, in the Empire Style and then in the Victorian period, when designs often became as densely packed as in 16th-century engravings, and the elegance and fancy of the style tended to be lost. </p>
<p> Artists began to give the tiny faces of the figures in grotesque decorations strange caricatured expressions, in a direct continuation of the medieval traditions of the drolleries in the border decorations or initials in illuminated manuscripts. From this the term began to be applied to larger caricatures, such as those of Leonardo da Vinci, and the modern sense began to develop. It is first recorded in English in 1646 from Sir Thomas Browne:"In nature there are no grotesques".[17] By extension backwards in time, the term became also used for the medieval originals, and in modern terminology medieval drolleries, half-human thumbnail vignettes drawn in the margins, and carved figures on buildings (that are not also waterspouts, and so gargoyles) are also called "grotesques". </p>
<p> A boom in the production of works of art in the grotesque genre characterized the period 1920–1933 of German art. In contemporary illustration art, the "grotesque" figures, in the ordinary conversational sense, commonly appear in the genre grotesque art, also known as fantastic art. </p>
<p> One of the first uses of the term grotesque to denote a literary genre is in Montaigne's Essays.[18] The Grotesque is often linked with satire and tragicomedy.[19] It is an effective artistic means to convey grief and pain to the audience, and for this has been labeled by Thomas Mann as the "genuine antibourgeois style".[19] </p>
<p> Some of the earliest written texts describe grotesque happenings and monstrous creatures. The literature of Myth has been a rich source of monsters; from the one-eyed Cyclops (to cite one example) from Hesiod's Theogony to Homer's Polyphemus in the Odyssey. Ovid's Metamorphoses is another rich source for grotesque transformations and hybrid creatures of myth. Horace's Art of Poetry also provides a formal introduction classical values and to the dangers of grotesque or mixed form. Indeed, the departure from classical models of order, reason, harmony, balance and form opens up the risk of entry into grotesque worlds. Accordingly, British literature abounds with native grotesquerie, from the strange worlds of Spenser's allegory in The Faerie Queene, to the tragi-comic modes of 16th-century drama. (Grotesque comic elements can be found in major works such as King Lear.) </p>
<p> Literary works of mixed genre are occasionally termed grotesque, as are "low" or non-literary genres such as pantomime and farce.[20] Gothic writings often have grotesque components in terms of character, style and location. In other cases, the environment described may be grotesque - whether urban (Charles Dickens), or the literature of the American south which has sometimes been termed "Southern Gothic". Sometimes the grotesque in literature has been explored in terms of social and cultural formations such as the carnival(-esque) in François Rabelais and Mikhail Bakhtin. Terry Castle has written on the relationship between metamorphosis, literary writings and masquerade.[21] </p>
<p> Another major source of the grotesque is in satirical writings of the 18th century. Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels provides a variety of approaches to grotesque representation. In poetry, the works of Alexander Pope provide many examples of the grotesque. </p>
<p> In fiction, characters are usually considered grotesque if they induce both empathy and disgust. (A character who inspires disgust alone is simply a villain or a monster.) Obvious examples would include the physically deformed and the mentally deficient, but people with cringe-worthy social traits are also included. The reader becomes piqued by the grotesque's positive side, and continues reading to see if the character can conquer their darker side. In Shakespeare's The Tempest, the figure of Caliban has inspired more nuanced reactions than simple scorn and disgust. Also, in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, the character of Gollum may be considered to have both disgusting and empathetic qualities, which fit him into the grotesque template. </p>
<p> Victor Hugo's Hunchback of Notre Dame is one of the most celebrated grotesques in literature. Dr. Frankenstein's monster can also be considered a grotesque, as well as the title character, Erik in The Phantom of the Opera and the Beast in Beauty and the Beast. Other instances of the romantic grotesque are also to be found in Edgar Allan Poe, E.T.A. Hoffmann, in Sturm und Drang literature or in Sterne's Tristram Shandy. The romantic grotesque is far more terrible and sombre than the medieval grotesque, which celebrated laughter and fertility. It is at this point that a grotesque creature such as Frankenstein's monster (in Mary Shelley's novel published in 1818) begins to be presented more sympathetically as the outsider who is the victim of society.[22] But the novel also makes the issue of sympathy problematic in an unkind society. This means that society becomes the generator of the grotesque, by a process of alienation.[23] In fact, the grotesque monster in Frankenstein tends to be described as 'the creature.' </p>
<p> The grotesque received a new shape with Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll, when a girl meets fantastic grotesque figures in her fantasy world. Carroll manages to make the figures seem less frightful and fit for children's literature, but still utterly strange. Another comic grotesque writer who played on the relationship between sense and nonsense was Edward Lear. Humorous, or festive nonsense of this kind has its roots in the seventeenth century traditions of fustian, bombastic and satirical writing.[24] </p>
<p> During the nineteenth-century category of grotesque body was increasingly displaced by the notion of congenital deformity or medical anomaly.[25] Building on this context, the grotesque begins to be understood more in terms as deformity and disability, especially after the First World War, 1914-18. In these terms, the art historian Leah Dickerman has argued that 'The sight of horrendously shattered bodies of veterans returned to the home front became commonplace. The accompanying growth in the prosthetic industry struck contemporaries as creating a race of half-mechanical men and became an important theme in dadaist work.'[26] The poetry of Wilfred Owen displays a poetic and realistic sense of the grotesque horror of war and the human cost of brutal conflict. Poems such as 'Spring Offensive' and 'Greater Love' combined images of beauty with shocking brutality and violence in order to produce a sense of the grotesque clash of opposites. In a similar fashion, Ernst Friedrich (1894–1967), founder of the Berlin Peace Museum, an anarchist and a pacifist, was the author of War Against War (1924) which used grotesque photographs of mutilated victims of the First World War in order to campaign for peace. </p>
<p> Southern Gothic is a genre frequently identified with grotesques and William Faulkner is often cited as the ringmaster. Flannery O'Connor wrote, "Whenever I'm asked why Southern writers particularly have a penchant for writing about freaks, I say it is because we are still able to recognize one" ("Some Aspects of the Grotesque in Southern Fiction", 1960). In O'Connor's often-anthologized short-story "A Good Man Is Hard to Find", the Misfit, a serial killer, is clearly a maimed soul, utterly callous to human life but driven to seek the truth. The less obvious grotesque is the polite, doting grandmother who is unaware of her own astonishing selfishness. Another oft-cited example of the grotesque from O'Connor's work is her short-story entitled "A Temple Of The Holy Ghost". The American novelist, Raymond Kennedy is another author associated with the literary tradition of the grotesque. </p>
<p> Other contemporary writers who have explored the grotesque in pop-culture are John Docker, in the context of postmodernism; Cintra Wilson, who analyzes celebrity; and Francis Sanzaro, who discusses its relation to childbirth and obscenity.[28] </p>
<p> The term Theatre of the Grotesque refers to an anti-naturalistic school of Italian dramatists, writing in the 1910s and 1920s, who are often seen as precursors of the Theatre of the Absurd. Characterized by ironic and macabre themes of daily life in the World War 1 era. Theatre of the Grotesque was named after the play 'The Mask and the Face' by Luigi Chiarelli, which was described as 'a grotesque in three acts.' </p>
<p> In architecture the term "grotesque" means a carved stone figure. </p>
<p> Grotesques are often confused with gargoyles, but the distinction is that gargoyles are figures that contain a water spout through the mouth, while grotesques do not. Without a water spout, this type of sculpture is also known as a chimera when it depicts fantastical creatures. In the Middle Ages, the term babewyn was used to refer to both gargoyles and grotesques.[29] This word is derived from the Italian word babbuino, which means "baboon". </p>
<p> The word "Grotesque", or "Grotesk" in German, is also frequently used as a synonym for sans-serif in typography. At other times, it is used (along with "Neo-Grotesque", "Humanist", "Lineal", and "Geometric") to describe a particular style or subset of sans-serif typefaces. The origin of this association can be traced back to English typefounder William Thorowgood, who first introduced the term "grotesque" and in 1835 produced 7-line pica grotesque—the first sans-serif typeface containing actual lowercase letters. An alternate etymology is possibly based on the original reaction of other typographers to such a strikingly featureless typeface.[30] </p>

<p> Is there as much change in the world than is anticipated? There are changes in technology and techniques to do things we as humans do, but is there as much change in the simple things in life than what we think there are? In history we have advanced in technology that's a given. There has always been technology there, but it has advanced and has changed some of our techniques in the way things are done. There has always been written stories for us to read and they have advanced but still have the same elements to them. Southern gothic literature has advanced and will keep advancing in ways, but most of the elements are still the same as when they started back before the civil war. There will always be classic gothic literature and this…show more content… </p>
<p> John will never be able to see what has happened to his place but he wouldn’t be happy with the decisions that happened after his death. The irony in this podcast shows us how it has been a part of southern gothic literature for as long as it has been around, and is still used the same as it has in the past. This is one example of how this is a classic piece of southern gothic literature, and the outsider element will also help explain. Outsiders are people looking in on a certain situation, in this podcast there are a lot of people that look in on many different situation. There are people that look into the situation that is occurring in woodstock, with being stuck in time. Brian comes to Woodstock and one of the first things that he mentions is that the town seems to be stuck in time and is failing to move up and advance with the rest of the world. He states that this town is stuck in time so many times in the podcast. There are different ways people look at new things, but the way they see their new environment for the first time their first impression will stick with them for the longest time. Olin seems to have the same interpretation towards Brian. He goes to Woodstock to see John and to get to know more about him and why he is the person he is.Olins first impression of John wasn´t the best, since Olin says,, “The difference is mine </p>
<p> Southern Gothic literature often incorporates its elements separately without any direct relationship between two of them, namely the grotesque and violence.

<p> Transformation of the Grotesque into the Gothic Novels </p>
<p> When 1778 dawned, twenty-five-year-old Frances Burney was not the egotist this pronouncement in her diary might suggest. She was nervous. Burney was a timid, prudish young woman who was concerned with her reputation and propriety. Though not even the publisher of Evelina knew her identity, she trembled, overcome by anxiety: Would the public know it was she who dared such an undertaking? Would they laugh? Scold? Would it be savoured and applauded, or would it fall into ignominy, become three volumes of discarded ephemera? And what would the father she idolizes says of his daughter’s secret venture? </p>
<p> Given the gendered barriers she stormed with Evelina, Burney had reason to fear. “An eighteenth-century woman writer, in order to be published at all and certainly to be read, was supposed to profess sensibility and womanliness, to avoid satire…and never to indite crude or low scenes,” Betty Rizzo writes. “Evelina broke all these strictures” (Rizzo 195). From Burney’s diaries, we know some early readers did not for a moment doubt the work was a man’s. Christopher Anstey, the writer of the New Bath Guide, was bandied about as a strong possibility (Ellis 215-7). That supposition, so far from the truth, bolstered Burney’s confidence, and she began to giddily record the praise her novel received. Her chronicles were exhaustive. Evelina garnered “almost universal admiration,” and Burney’s anonymity held fast for six months, after which time she became something of a celebrity (Doody 39). Contemporaries found her work prodigiously entertaining and bewitching (Ellis 215, 220). The Critical Review called it “amusing and instructive” (202-3) and The Monthly Review said it was “one of the most sprightly, entertaining, and agreeable productions” of its kind (316). They applauded the diversity of the characters (particularly the Branghtons) and “the great variety of natural incidents, some of the comic stamp” (The Monthly Review 316). </p>
<p> Such praise would not be the standard for Burney’s thirty-six-year career as a novelist. Contemporaries and critics, present and future alike, became more and more displeased with her work. The characters seemed to be caricatures of individuals she had already crafted. The plots became more chaotic and the novels themselves, at five volumes and upwards of one thousand pages, were too long. As George Saintsbury noted in 1895, Evelina was delectable; Cecilia admirable; Camilla estimable; The Wanderer impossible (212). While Evelina remained popular, if not a favourite, Burney’s last three novels fell out of print through the nineteenth century and clean copies of the trio proved difficult to find. It wasn’t until scholars professing an interest in women’s studies in the mid-twentieth century knocked the dust from the jackets of Cecilia, Camilla, and The Wanderer that Burney’s works were plumbed for more than what met the eye of her peers. </p>
<p> The superficiality with which the quartet has been viewed is deceptive. Alternatively labelled sentimental novels, social comedies, conduct books, and “picture of manners” (McK. 360), Burney’s canon had, for a century and a half, been taken at face value. The satire was obvious, the comedy was inspired—but that was all. As meaning was slowly teased from the pages, critiques reflected the analytical trends of the time: domesticity, psychoanalysis, marginality. And then, in 1976, Modern Philology published an essay by Susan Staves titled “‘Evelina;’ or, Female Difficulties.” During a time when domestic violence was at the forefront of second-wave feminist concern, Staves observed a painfully obvious trend, one that she found peculiarly absent from the critical consensus on Evelina: Descriptions of the novel make it appear to be a combination of the usual romance with cheerful, albeit occasionally malicious, satire. The primary criticism of the book is that it is hopelessly trivial. Yet Evelina’s predominant emotion seems to me to be an acute anxiety which is painful, real, and powerful. (368) </p>
<p> Staves argues that Evelina’s anxiety is “partly provoked by physical violence and threats of violence,” which “we may notice immediately” (369). Julia Epstein’s 1989 book, The Iron Pen: Frances Burney and the Politics of Women’s Writing, also discusses the pervasive violence, as does Barbara Zonitch’s 1997 Familiar Violence: Gender and Social Upheaval in the Novels of Frances Burney. These analyses probe deeply into a glaring characteristic of Burney’s novels that contemporaries and reviewers have historically evaded, but they still fail to grasp the full picture. While her peers saw largely a comedy, these critics see largely violence. It has only been passingly suggested that there exists in all four novels a union between the two. </p>
<p> This is a pure understatement. In this paper, I shall argue that the coexistence of comedy and violence is an essential characteristic of Burney’s novels. One cannot be ignored in favour of the other for Burney does not merely alternate humour and harm. The two mingle in her works, merging rather than dissociating to create the effect of the grotesque, a delightful form of horror that has readers gasping with laughter even as their minds reel from the terrific situations she crafts. Burney diverges from the early formula of the gothic novel, with its atmosphere of mystery and horror and the inevitable medieval castle setting (“Gothic”), choosing instead for her first three novels selectively to embrace a genre that is meant to repulse readers. For the last, she builds upon the gothic aesthetic established in the horror novels of the late-eighteenth century, with doses of melodrama and social satire lightening the realistic if not grotesquely abhorrent terror of her early novels. Her variety of the grotesque is that of the macabre, or black humour, and she makes use of the “gliding scale” Dieter Petzold describes, “from the almost purely humorous to the deeply shocking.” The result is disturbing, prompting readers to question why such a “delicate” girl would write such “boisterous” books, as Elizabeth Montagu, an art patroness and bluestocking society leader, commented (Lynch). </p>
<p> Why indeed? Let us first consider these events as repeating instances within a pattern rather than as anomalies. The majority of the events occur in public places intended for polite socialization, such as the pleasure garden Ranelagh, the opera house, or the carriage. When this does not hold true, they serve as the climax of a long-building emotional dilemma caused by society; the expectation of moneyed splendour despite the realities of debt is a favoured motif. Nearly without fail, all of the grotesque events Burney pens show the subjugation of women at the hands of men and a society that overwhelming favours their gender, legally, theoretically, and culturally. I read these events, then, as part of Burney’s social commentary. Given the revulsion she inspires through her use of the grotesque rather than through pure comedy or violence, the extreme inferiority of women to men and the violence that is a product of such a relationship seems to be her greatest complaint. Her heroines and the supporting female characters are second-class citizens—perhaps even third or fourth, depending upon their age and socioeconomic status. Without restitution, they are abused, both domestically and otherwise, often under the guise of safety—in the presence of a protector or guardian or in a so-called social haven for innocents. Burney seeks not to cajole, not to educate, not to suggest such things might be objectionable. By employing the grotesque, she strategically seeks to appal her readers. </p>

Abstract
In literary and cultural studies, the gothic is a genre or mode whose
dark imagery often includes medieval ruins, supernatural occurrences, and
demonic protagonists. To show Poe's use of the gothic elements in his poem
"The Raven" is the aim of the present study. The study falls into five
sections.
The first section forms the introduction that deals with the definition
of the gothic term and alludes to its origin. While the second section treats
the literary use of the gothic style which came into being in (1764) when
Horace Walpole published his novel The Castle of Otranto which became a
sample of the gothic novel that was followed later by other novelists. The
third section tackles Poe's distinguished gothic style, which addresses man
psychologically. His imaginative, mysterious mad heroes and his nightmare
world are also discussed. The fourth section offers a short definition of Poe's
"The Raven" and gives a general idea about the poem. The core of the study
is represented by the last section, which displays the gothic elements in "The
Raven".

1. Introduction
Gothic appeared as a style of art in Europe during the last part
of the Middle Ages, (twelfth to sixteenth centuries). The gothic style
of that period was expressed in "architecture, sculpture, panel
painting, illuminated manuscripts, stained glass, jewellery and
textiles"(1).
The term gothic came from the "Goths" a "northen Germanic
barbarian pagan tribes which invaded former territories of the
Christian Roman Empire century A.D"(2). The Goths who were very
interested in Christianity that affected their architectural and artistic
works first used the gothic style. They created a distinctive style of
grotesque, horror and exaggeration. The gothic style, which differed
from the "subtle" and "controlled" Roman style, was simple and
displayed general ideas particularly religious matters(3).

The main concern of the gothic style was to express the
catholic faith through dealing with the presence of God. However,
pagan doctrine in nature and "elemental spirits whose power was to
prevent evil"(4), still occupied the gothic style. These ideas and
symbols were particularly incarnated in the architecture of
cathedrals(5). Hence, in gothic style, pagan appeared to support the
idea of Christianity, which by itself a contrasting matter that explores
the essence of this style.

The Gothic Elements in Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven"

The gothic style of the artists before the fifteenth century was
away from personal feelings or self – expression. After that, the
pictorial art of the artist became a reflection of his own imagination,
which was distinguished by its horrible nature. The gothic paintings
presented violence through surreal, fearful images in order to provide
the sense of horror(6). It deserves mentioning, that the term gothic
never used during that period which was called by the Renaissance
"The Dark Ages". During the Enlightment the gothic style was
ignored for it dealt with brutality and superstitions. At any rate, the
term gothic came into being in the mid-to-late eighteenth century
when medieval period became a great inspiration of many literary
works(7).

2- The literary use of the Gothic style
The term gothic came to be applied to the literary genre
precisely because the genre dealt with such emotional extremes and
very dark themes, and because it found its most natural settings in the
buildings of this style-haunted castles, mansions, and monasteries
often remote and ruined(8).

Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto (1764) introduced the
brooding characteristics of the gothic fiction in England. This novel
established the main features of the gothic novel thus; it became a
proto-type followed by other novelists. The gothic novel was

fascinated by the horrible, the grotesque and the supernatural. Night
and sunless environment is the best atmosphere for the gothic action.
The atmosphere of mystery and suspense may be found in old
castles, forests and mountains. These fearful, haunted places suit the
gothic heroes and heroines who live alone in complete fear and
alienation, obliged to be decisive to find solutions to their own
problems. The origins of these protagonists are mysterious for they are
either orphans or foundlings. They could also be demonic(9).

Gothic themes emphasize the persistence of the past and
history's grip on the present, and take place against a backdrop where
few characters are innocent, and most of them are damned. Gothic
narratives often stress embodiment, with all its attendant possibilities
for sensation, as well as the fear of decay. "The themes of the literary
gothic have been translated into other media such as the theatre and
had a notable revival in twentieth century gothic horror films such as
the classic universal horro films of the 1930"(10).
Gothic genre also influenced the American writings(11) and the
most prominent writer was Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) whose
gothic style expanded to include his poems.

3. Poe and the gothic Style

22

Buhuth Mustaqbaliya (35) 2011, 1432A.H.

The Gothic Elements in Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven"

Poe is known primarily for his mastery of the gothic genre. He
is a professional artist in horrors. Poe is influenced by the gothic
novels of the eighteenth century and he develops the use of the gothic
element. He presents vague, mysterious and complicated stories,
which address man psychologically. In "The philosophy of
composition", Poe mentions that his works are "conscious exploration
of morbid psychology"(12).
Poe's work has a unique style that defines him immediately to
the reader. The settings of his stories are dark, gloomy and horrific.
The events of stories like, "The Tell-Tale Heart", "Hop-Frog", "The
Cask of Amontillado", and "Ligeia", occur at night. The element of
darkness is important in Poe's stories because it stands for evil that
increases the reader's feeling of suspense. The places of these stories
are of a gothic nature. "The Fall of the House of Usher", for example,
the house stands on the edge of a tarn. Its appearance is like the dull
day in which the events happen. It is a view of melancholy and dismay
that suits the "horrifying mood of Poe's stories"(13).
The action in Poe's gothic fiction is strange and grotesque that
enhances the sense of discomfort and horror. The horrifying action
may lead the characters in Poe's stories to be mad. Thus, the element
of madness adds mystery and strangeness to his literary works(14).
Poe's nightmare world is not only a "method of explaining the
mystery of the universe"(15); it is also psychologically employed to
portray "the minds awareness of itself"(16). In short, Poe's short stories

Ghada A. Mohammed

and poems reflect a state of man's inner world. Horror is inside and
outside man; Poe successfully marries the two to give birth to a
horrible world of mystery and destruction. This is obvious in his
symbols. In The Fall of the House of Usher, for instance, the crack in
the Usher mansion suggests a fundamental split in the twin's
(Roderick and Madeline) personality and anticipates the final ruin of
both mansion and family.
At any rate, there is inevitable relationship between death and
horror, in other words, death is the main source of horror. Death is the
truth whose essence is out of man's reach; it is the unknown, which
means the fearful matter. Thus, death is adopted to be the subject of
horror in gothic literary works. Poe also uses death as a gothic tool.
This can be touched in "The Raven"; Lenore's death causes the horror
in which the hero lives, as it will be explained later.

4. The Raven (1845)
Edgar Allan Poe "The Raven" is a dark reflection on lost love,
death, and loss of hope. The poem examines the emotions of a young
man who has lost his lover to death and who tries unsuccessfully to
distract himself from his sadness through books. Books, however,
prove to be of little help, as his night becomes a nightmare and a
single visitor, the raven, shatters his solitude.

5. The Gothic Elements in "The Raven"

24

Buhuth Mustaqbaliya (35) 2011, 1432A.H.

The Gothic Elements in Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven"

"The Raven" can be considered a gothic poem because it has
the elements that distinguish it as such. The following gothic factors
will present the gothic identity of the poem.
5.1 Setting
The poem opens with a description of scared and dull setting:
once upon a midnight dreary …" (L.1) which spells gloom and fear
over the reader. The most suitable time for fearful events is midnight
and when that midnight belongs to "the bleak December" (L.7) the
horrific touch increases. Both "midnight" and "December" symbolize
an end of something, they may symbolize Lenore's or the narrator's
end because Lenore's death means the end of their love and of his
happy life.
The room in which the lover lives is portrayed in terms of
horror and depression:
In addition, the silken, sad uncertain rustling of each purple
curtain. Thrilled me-filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before
(LL. 13–14)
The movement and sound of the curtains fill the lover with
terror, the simple furniture then becomes a source of horror. The
tapping on his door at midnight also creates a fearful sense. Hence,
horror is outside and inside the room. Eventually, the whole
atmosphere is ready now to receive the sudden black visitor, the
raven, which lands on a Greek eyless statue in the lover's room."[The
Raven] perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door".
Future Studies Centre- Al-Hadba’ Un. College

25

Ghada A. Mohammed

(L.41). This statue may refer to the lover himself for, in his
"philosophy of composition", poe states that "the bust of pallas being
chosen, …, as most in keeping with the scholarship of the lover".(17)
Hence, in a way or another, the statue can be seen as an
emblem of the student who is accordingly cannot see or feel because
of his grief. At any rate, there is a strong relationship between the
time, the place, the furniture, and the lover. The main connection
between them is fear; there is a frightened lover at a fearful time in a
horrific house. The events happen in a room in a "home by Horror
haunted". (L.96) and instead of the ruined sections that can be found
in a castle in a gothic story, one can touch the ruined soul and
thoughts of the student.
The dark thoughts of the student and the gloomy and dark
setting may focus the light on the darkness of the poem.
5.2 Darkness and Silence
Darkness is an inevitable element used to support the gothic
style. It is a symbol of vagueness, which is the main characteristic of
Poe's writings. Darkness means the unknown that fears everybody.
Hence, "The Raven"s hero must be afraid when he opens the door and
sees "Darkness there and nothing more" (L.24). He contemplates the
darkness, wonders, and the power of darkness makes him dream about
"… dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before" (L.26). "Peering",
"wondering", fearing", "doubting", and dreaming" all these matters

26

Buhuth Mustaqbaliya (35) 2011, 1432A.H.

The Gothic Elements in Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven"

occur at the same time and they are normal reactions to the sense of
horror.
Silence is another important fearful factor employed in Poe's
"The Raven". Here, silence seems part of darkness. Darkness in the
poem is dumb which may suggest the student's disability to discover
the truth, for there is no token, "But the silence was unbroken, and the
stillness gave no token" (L.27). Darkness carries no clue to explore the
mystery of knock, and the lover hears only the echo of his word
Lenore, "And the only word there spoken was the whispered word,
Lenore!" (L.28). the word he hears is so weak it is just a whisper that
leads to more vagueness. In fact, the silent darkness increases the
young man's internal conflict, "… all my soul within me
burning"(L.31).
The image of darkness goes further to represent death. In other
words, the act of horror is portrayed as that of death, after death man's
home is darkness and silence is the language of graves. The hero's
mistress is dead, when he opens the door (after hearing the tapping) he
expects her soul, he tries to explore her world but he faces darkness
and silence with soul full of fear. It seems seeking the truth leads to
hell, and to self-burning which is a grotesque matter and on element of
the gothic style.
5.3 Loneliness
The loneliness of the student by itself is a gothic factor. After
Lenore's death, he lives alone among his books reading the "curious

27

Ghada A. Mohammed

volumes of forgotten lore" (L.2). It seems that the word "forgotten"
gives the reader a sense of alienation and oldness; it is a deserted lore,
which could be haunted by old spirits. Thus, the word may carry a
ghostly flavour and a touch of loneliness. The dark chamber in which
the lover is placed is used to show his emptiness and loneliness, now
that he is without his lost Lenore.
Poe's protagonist is disappointed; his hopes to live happily with
his beloved have flown. He even expects the departure of the Raven
for he used to live alone without friends.
Till I scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown
before on the morrow he [the Raven] will leave me, as my hopes have
flown before (LL.58-59)
The bereaved lover's state of loneliness and depression leads to
his obsession with the idea of meeting his mistress' soul, however,
when the Raven appears he cannot believe that the moment is real. For
him it seems very odd. Although he doubts the situation, he gives up
and loses hold on himself and on reality. Hence, the lover believes
that.
The Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only that one
word [nevermore], as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
(LL.54-55)
The fowl's word "nevermore" reflects the situation of the lover:
he will not see Lenore, he will not live happy, and he will live alone
until the end of his life. Such state of endless loneliness and

The Gothic Elements in Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven"

depression leads to the man's insanity, which all contribute to the
gothic aura of the poem.
It deserves mentioning that such state of isolation is just
a reflection of Poe's feeling. The tragedies in Poe's life are shown in
The Raven, and can be predominately seen through the comparison
between the loss of his wife, and the student's loss of Lenore. The
apparent tone in The Raven represents a very painful condition of
mind, an intellect sensitive to madness and the abyss of melancholy
brought upon by the death of a beloved lady. The student asks if he
will see his mistress in the afterlife. After Virginia's death, Poe tried to
relieve his grief by drinking. A parallelism is formed in The Raven
between the condescending actions of the Raven towards the student
and the taunting of alcohol towards Poe. The Raven declares that the
student will never see his lost love again when uttering, "Forget this
lost Lenore" (L.83). Alcohol taunts Poe into ceaseless depression and
causes him to have a life – long problem with alcoholism, which
eventually ended his life.(18) Poe's sorrowful life seems to have been
the fuel for his dark and gothic writings. In short, the poet's horrible
loneliness is employed to enhance the gothic element.
5.4 The Mystery
The atmosphere of mystery and suspense is a vital gothic
element in Poe's The Raven. Throughout the poem, there is a feeling
of fear enhanced by the unknown. The lover is roused from his sleepy
state by a tapping on the door, which begins to terrify him because he

is longing for Lenore, but finds nothing instead or rather the Raven.
This scene then contains the typical gothic elements of mystery,
ghosts, and supernatural.(19)
To conclude, The Raven is pervaded by mystery; as the sudden
appearance of the Raven, the speech of the black bird "Nevermore",
and the mystery of death itself and life after death. In fact, the whole
poem is a mystery and the solution for the mystery forms, to some
extent, another mystery particularly when the lover asks "Is there – is
there balm in Gilead?" (L.97)
What is there beyond death? Is there any further release from
anguish? Can he meet Lenore (his balm) there? The Raven answers
"Nevermore". The hero aims to find a solution to the mystery of death,
but the vague answer leads him to nowhere, which again enhances the
mystery of the poem.
5.5 The Unreliable Narrator
The narrator's point of view toward the raven is characterized
by its changeability. At the beginning of the poem, the narrator of The
Raven shows his fear because of the knock of the unknown visitor.
When he opens the window and the Raven flies in, he feels happy
"then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling" (L.43). He
also shows his respect for the fowl by calling him "lordly". (L.47)(20).
The Raven appears to be a source of hope and consolation. The
narrator thinks the bird is a "prophet" (L.85) sent by God "thy God
hath… sent thee" (L.81) to tell him something about his lost Lenore.

30

Buhuth Mustaqbaliya (35) 2011, 1432A.H.

The Gothic Elements in Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven"

He longs for reunion in heaven with "a sainted maiden whom the
angels name Lenore" (L.94). The narrator begs the Raven to tell him
something pleasant about his beloved, he seeks comfort but the Raven
gives no comfortable answer. Then his emotions toward the bird
change and he describes it as "thing of evil"(L.91) and as "devil"
(L.91) and defines his "fiery eyes" (L.74) as those of "a demon"
(L.105). The narrator also calls the Raven as "…grim, ungainly,
ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird" (L.76) and as a "beast" (L.52). All
these fearful and hateful features are given to the fowl because,
according to the narrator, it is a dreaded emblem of death. Hence, the
Raven fails to be a symbol of hope and consolation; however, it
becomes an explorer of reality.
The narrator seeks the truth; he wants to know what is meant
by the word "nevermore"? "… What this ominous bird… Meant in
croaking 'nevermore'" (LL.71-72). For the unstable narrator, the
Raven is still the object of hope, the hope of knowing something about
Lenore, knowing something beyond the barriers of ignorance.
Although he suspects the raven as a prophet or a devil, yet he begs the
Raven to tell him the truth about man's end.
Besides the narrator's uncertainty of the identity of the Raven,
he is also uncertain of man's state after death. In addition to that, the
narrator believes that the recovery of his bleeding heart is associated
with the departure of the Raven "Take thy beak from out my heart"
(L.101), but the Raven "Quoth… 'Nevermore'" (L.102). According to
Future Studies Centre- Al-Hadba’ Un. College

31

Ghada A. Mohammed

the narrator, the Raven will never leave him, which is incredible
matter that asserts his insanity. Eventually, the trinity of insanity,
uncertainty and changeability presents the young man as unreliable
narrator, which is another gothic element that strengthens the gothic
show of the poem.
5.6 Other Basic Gothic Elements
In addition to the previous gothic factors, four characteristics
allow a work to be labeled as "gothic". The first is that there are a
victim and torture, here the victim is the speaker and the Raven is
obviously torturing him in that he will not respond with anything other
than "nevermore", seemingly driving him crazy.
The second characteristic is that the torturer is either evil or has
supernatural powers; this is also true in the poem since the Raven can
speak (supernatural merit) and the speaker refers to it many times as
being evil or demon – like. Third, the work must have some type of
setting that the victim cannot escape. Here, it would seem that the
speaker could easily walk out of the room but since he thinks that the
Raven has some information for him about his lost love, he feels like
he must stay and is, in essence, trapped (21).
The poem is also full of gothic vocabularies(22) such as terror,
scare, wondering, fearing, whispered, mystery, beast, ghastly, unseen,
ghost, enchanted, horror, haunted, demon. The employment of such
words in the poem is necessary to suit its gothic nature. Besides,

breathlessness and panic are common in this gothic poem. Finally,
Poe's The Raven is a prime example of gothic poetry at its finest.

Conclusion
The gothic elements pervade Poe's "The Raven" from the
beginning until the end. The setting is portrayed in a gothic way; the
bereaved lover's gloomy room and his haunted house are fearfully
described at midnight during the cold December. This setting prepares
the reader to receive another important gothic factor i.e. darkness and
silence. After opening the door, the lover cannot see but darkness and
cannot hear but weak whisper and then silence, which suggests
vagueness and grotesque.

The Gothic Elements in Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven"

The young man's feeling of loneliness, after his mistress' death,
is another gothic characteristic in "The Raven" which appears to be a
reflection of subjective experience. Mystery is a pervasive gothic
element in the poem. It is represented by the mysterious appearance of
the raven and its mysterious and tiresome word 'nevermore', besides
the mystery of life after death, which lead to the unknown, and
strangeness. These gothic elements of mystery, ghosts and
supernatural form the subject of "The Raven" i.e. the mind's loss of
any hold on reality. These factors contribute to create insane hero and
unreliable narrator, which is another gothic aspect in the poem.
Finally, the poem is a report by imagination in gothic terms.

<p> Southern Gothic Characteristics </p>
<p> Novel and Short Story </p>
<p> Southern Gothic is most closely associated with prose fiction, as in novels and short stories. For one thing, Southern Gothic is partly inspired by Gothic literature, and most Gothic literature was also written as prose fiction. </p>
<p> The most famous works of Southern Gothic literature are novels like William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury or Carson McCullers's The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, as well as short stories like Faulkner's "A Rose for Emily" or Flannery O'Connor's "A Good Man is Hard to Find." </p>
<p> As always, there's totally an important exception: Tennessee Williams. Williams was a playwright, and though a lot of his work deals with familiar Southern Gothic themes—decay, for instance, is a big one in his work—he mostly wrote, well, plays. </p>
<p> Shmoops: </p>
<p> William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury is one of the most famous (and awesome) novels in the Southern Gothic tradition. Explore why it made such a splash here. </p>
<p> Flannery O'Connor's "A Good Man is Hard to Find" is a classic Southern Gothic short story. It deals with a whole range of themes, from society and class to family. Check out these themes here. </p>
<p> Irony </p>
<p> Irony is a word that gets thrown around a lot (we're looking at you, Alanis), but what does it actually mean? Well, in literature, it can mean a couple of things. First, there's what you could call an ironic use of language: that's when an author (or a character) says the opposite of what he or she means. It's like saying, "That fedora is totally hot," when what you really mean is, "That fedora is totally fugs." </p>
<p> In literature, there's also what you could call an ironic turn of events. That's when the plot of a story takes the characters (and us readers) somewhere totally unexpected—in fact, the opposite of where you'd expect things to end up. That would be like if a story about a tea party with stuffed animals ended with a high-speed car chase and dramatic rooftop shoot-out. </p>
<p> Southern Gothic literature is full of irony. This partly has to do with the history of the South. This was a region that had been extremely wealthy and powerful for much of its history, thanks to slavery, but the South's defeat in the Civil War meant that this once super-powerful and super-wealthy region found itself, well, permanently down in the dumps. Southern Gothic writers deal with the irony of Southern history by writing about characters and events whose lives are shaped by irony. </p>
<p> Shmoops: </p>
<p> Thomas Sutpen, in William Faulkner's Absalom, Absalom!, spends his whole life trying to prove that he's better than black people. The irony is that he ends up marrying a woman who is part black. Check out this character's story here. </p>
<p> Big Daddy Pollitt in Tennessee Williams's Cat on a Hot Tin Roof tries to ignore his own mortality by acquiring huge amounts of wealth. In this quotation (Quote #6), Big Daddy wakes up to an ironic truth: he can't actually escape his mortality. </p>
<p> Macabre and Grotesque </p>
<p> Southern Gothic writers have a pretty kinky taste for the macabre and the grotesque. No, seriously: these folks are into things like incest, decomposing bodies, castration, and lot more. </p>
<p> Are Southern Gothic writers just weird? What gives? Well, for one thing, Southern Gothic literature is partly inspired by Gothic literature, which is all about horror and spooky stuff. Secondly, Southern Gothic writers were writing about a defeated society: the South is the part of the country that lost the Civil War. The war itself was a pretty grotesque experience, and it lived on in people's memories for a very long time, so it's really no wonder that we see elements of that grotesqueness in the work of Southern Gothic writers. </p>
<p> Shmoops: </p>
<p> William Faulkner's "A Rose for Emily" ends with the discovery of a corpse in Ms. Emily's bedroom. Talk about grotesque. Here's an analysis of the ending. </p>
<p> Mr. Guizac, one of the protagonists of Flannery O'Connor's story "The Displaced Person," dies in a pretty grotesque way. Have a look at this excerpt (Quote #5) depicting his death. </p>
<p> Social Issues </p>
<p> Southern Gothic writers love, just love, commenting on social issues—social issues that pertain to Southern society, that is. Themes of honor, betrayal, integrity, and hypocrisy, among others, are central to Southern Gothic literature. </p>
<p> Southern Gothic writers are interested in questions like: What are Southern values? What sort of hypocrisy underlies these values? What makes Southern cultural and social identity unique? The South, after all, was a society that had condoned slavery for hundreds of years. What kind of moral integrity does a society like that have? Southern Gothic writers explore the question of moral integrity, in particular, by exploring social issues in their work—from family, to race, to poverty. </p>
<p> Shmoops: </p>
<p> Social issues are a big theme in Flannery O'Connor's "A Good Man is Hard to Find." Check out the way in which the story treats this theme here. </p>
<p> Homosexuality was a taboo subject at the time that Tennessee Williams was writing, but he doesn't shy away from tackling this issue in his play Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Here are characters talking about, and dealing with, sex and sexuality in the play. </p>
<p> Violence </p>
<p> Slavery is a pretty violent thing. Owning other people, forcing them to work, and having the power of life and death over them? It's pretty extreme. And that means that violence has been a big part of Southern society for a long time. </p>
<p> So it's no surprise that there are a lot of depictions of violence in Southern Gothic literature. Sometimes this violence is about race, and sometimes it's not: the point is that the threat is always there. Southern Gothic writers, in fact, depict violence as part of the mentality, the culture, and the society of the South in general. So if you're squeamish about violence, you'd better get ready—there's lots and lots of it in Southern Gothic. </p>
<p> Shmoops: </p>
<p> In Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, men are depicted as violent and aggressive. Check out how masculinity and violence come together in the play. </p>
<p> In Flannery O'Connor's short story "The Displaced Person," Mr. Guizac comes to work on a farm in the southern U.S. after fleeing Europe and WWII. He ends up being killed in a gruesome way by the other bigoted protagonists in the story. Here's the excerpt (Quote #5). </p>
<p> Southern Setting </p>
<p> We can't talk about Southern Gothic without talking about the landscape of the South. Plantations, wilderness, small dusty towns, grand old houses—these aren't just nice little decorative touches; they're essential to the Southern Gothic genre. </p>
<p> Southern Gothic writers are obsessed with Southern landscapes and Southern settings because the identity of the South is largely derived from the land. Land, after all, is central to Southern history: during the period of slavery, the wealth of the South came mostly from the cultivation of the land, particularly from the cotton fields. Often, the beauty of the land stands in stark (and ironic) contrast to the violence happening on it and because of it. </p>
<p> Shmoops: </p>
<p> The Southern landscape is brought to life in William Faulkner's Absalom, Absalom! Here are some quotations reflecting just how important this setting is in the novel. </p>
<p> The setting of Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird is the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama. Delve into an analysis of this Southern setting here. </p>
<p> Decay </p>
<p> Lots of stuff is falling apart in Southern Gothic literature: people are falling apart; houses are falling apart; towns are falling apart; morals are falling apart. This is decay and decomposition city, folks. </p>
<p> Decay's such a big theme in Southern Gothic literature because the South was, after all, on the losing side in the Civil War, and this loss permanently changed the Southern way of life. The end of slavery meant the end of the Southern economy, and that led to a sense that the whole culture and society of the South was falling apart. </p>
<p> So the theme of decay and decomposition is prominent partly because Southern Gothic writers were writing at a time when the South was in decline. But Southern Gothic writers also often reflect on how the South's history of slavery and racial oppression itself led to moral and social corruption: the South brought these problems on itself, they seem to say. </p>
<p> Shmoops: </p>
<p> The house that Ms. Emily lives in in William Faulkner's short story "A Rose for Emily" is already falling apart at the beginning of the story. Check out how the narrator describes this decay here (Quote #1). </p>
<p> Blanche, the heroine of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, is an alcoholic who is falling apart. In these quotations from the play, we see how she's unraveled by alcohol. </p>
<p> Outsiders </p>
<p> If you're reading Southern Gothic literature, chances are pretty good you're reading about outsiders. Many, if not most, of the heroes and heroines of these works are people who are outside the norm on some way—sometimes physically, sometimes mentally, and sometimes in terms of race or class. </p>
<p> These outcasts are often the characters who drive the plot forward in Southern Gothic lit. One reason Southern Gothic authors like to write about outsider characters is that outsiders reflect, in a different ways, the identity of the South: the South itself was a renegade society, especially after its defeat in the War. If you were a writer, then seeing all that grotesque decay around you would probably make you feel like an outsider in your own society, too. </p>
<p> Shmoops: </p>
<p> Benjy Compson, one of the protagonists in William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, is one of the most famous "outsider" figures in Southern Gothic literature. Find an analysis of his character here. </p>
<p> John Singer, the mute protagonist of Carson McCullers's The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, is another "outsider" character. Check out how his consciousness frames the whole narrative here. </p>
<p> Civil War </p>
<p> So, we've mentioned the Civil War a few—okay, a gazillion times already. Don't blame us: it's because that war is really freaking important in Southern history, and in Southern Gothic literature. Southern Gothic writers were doing their thing in the aftermath of the Civil War (it was a long aftermath), and its shadow is always looming over their work. Faulkner, in particular, is totally obsessed. </p>
<p> The point is that the Civil War came to define Southern identity. This was a huge, huge loss for the South—at least for the people there who weren't slaves, that is. </p>
<p> Shmoops: </p>
<p> Take a look at how Mr. Compson, in William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, comments on how everybody came out a loser in the Civil War (Quote #1). </p>
<p> A character in Carson McCullers's The Heart is Lonely Hunter reflects on her great-grandfather, who fought in the Civil War (Quote #5). </p>
<p> Slavery and Race </p>
<p> The South was a society built on slavery and racial oppression. Before the Civil War, the South's economy, its social values, even its geography were determined by slavery and racial oppression. </p>
<p> You can't really talk about the South without talking about that history, and Southern Gothic writers are no exception. These writers are all about asking tough questions: How did slavery and race affect the values of Southern society? In what ways did its history of racial oppression corrupt the South? How did the legacy of slavery continue to haunt the South even after the Civil War? </p>
<p> Shmoops: </p>
<p> Sutpen, a cruel slave-owner in William Faulkner's Absalom, Absalom! pits his black slaves against one another in this quotation (Quote #2) from the novel. </p>
<p> Colonel Sartoris in William Faulkner's "A Rose for Emily" is a pretty racist dude. In fact, he's in charge of making up edicts and laws that demean African Americans—as we can see in this excerpt from the story (Quote #2). </p>

<p> Gothic Fiction and the Grotesque </p>
<p> Maximillian E. Novak </p>
<p> Novel: A Forum on Fiction, 13:1 (1980), 50-66 </p>
<p> {[50]} When Henry Tilney decides to lecture Catherine Morland on the absurdity of carrying her fascination with Gothic fiction into her perception of ordinary life, his strictures have to be read in terms of the total context of Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey. Whatever he has to say is undercut by the pleasure he takes in feeling so completely superior to Catherine, whom he loves for her openness, her good looks and her "very ignorant mind."1 He too is an admirer of Mrs. Radcliffe, but he sees the possible danger of her works on susceptible minds: </p>
<p> Dear Miss Morland, consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained. What have you been judging from? Remember that we are English, that we are Christians. Consult your own understanding, your own sense of the probable, your own observation of what is passing around you -- Does our education prepare us for such atrocities? Do our laws connive at them? Could they be perpetrated without being known in a country like this, where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing; where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies, and where roads and newspapers lay every thing open? Dearest Miss Morland, what ideas have you been admitting?2 </p>
<p> Jane Austen is fully aware that the thrill of Gothic fiction, apart from its "charming" qualities, was like the vertigo connected with dancing and jumping, a sexual surrogate for teenage girls, but Henry Tilney's criticisms are more than psychological. Having previously acknowledged his own "pleasure" in reading The Mysteries of Udolpho, Tilney subjects Gothic fictions to an examination of their relationship to the historical and ethical experiences of nineteenth-century English men and women. He clearly regards them as grotesque, and it is as a grotesque mode that I wish to approach Gothic fiction. </p>
<p> By "grotesque," I simply mean the combination of conventionalized organizational structures, ideas and characters in fiction dealing with the supernatural and bizarre from the time of Horace Walpole to the present day.3 In the following pages, I intend to examine Gothic fiction from the standpoints of what appear to me the crucial critical problems: the relationship of Gothic fiction to history and the past, the connection between Gothic and Grotesque, the Grotesque villain, and finally, Gothic form. </p>
<p> {51} </p>
<p> I </p>
<p> In his review of Lewis' The Monk, Coleridge added to the general chorus of those wishing a speedy end to Gothic fiction. "We trust," he remarked, ". . .that satiety will banish what good sense should have prevented; and that wearied with fiends, incomprehensible characters, with shrieks, murders, and subterranean dungeons, the public will learn . . . with how little expense of thought or imagination this species of composition is manufactured."4 Isaac Disraeli in Vaurien (1797) also found Gothic novels objectionable and unnatural, comparing their effect to that of "'The Magical Mirror,' exhibited not long ago in this place of exhibition, London; where after viewing the charming delusion of grapes swelling into a blooming maturity, or faces angelically smiling, suddenly their appeared a most hideous skeleton's scull, distending its terrific jaws."5 Writers on Gothic fiction continue to feel the same embarrassment. G. R. Thompson complains that "when the word Gothic is applied to literature it merely evokes images of ghosts, demons, trapdoors, castles."6 Such a reputation, he argues, is unfortunate, and in an effort to beef up the Gothic mode, he suggests "Dark Romanticism" as a better term. Under that title, works like Moby-Dick or The Castle may be brought in to make Gothic fiction respectable. </p>
<p> Thompson refuses to look into the Magical Mirror. The skeleton with its combination of deathly terror and horrible grin is the essence of the grotesque and the essence of the Gothic. Slightly more silly than Holbein's figure of death, he sits at the front of Rowlandson's English Dance of Death (1815-1816) as evidence of continued interest in the lighter and more sententious aspects of contemporary grotesque literature into the nineteenth century. And his involuntary grin plays over the "straight black lips" of Frankenstein's monster.7 If Wolfgang Kayser can complain of the limitations of the grotesque itself as "one of those quickly cheapened terms," how much more limited is that aspect of the grotesque that is exploited by the Gothic.8 But there is no use making the very concept of the Gothic as a fictional mode meaningless in order to lend it more scope than it had. Works like Moby-Dick may utilize certain Gothic effects, but they are not essentially Gothic. If skeletons, shrieks, old castles and trap doors are an embarrassment to the critic of Gothic fiction, he might as well turn his interests elsewhere. </p>
<p> Since I am on the subject of defining the Gothic in terms of the grotesque, let {52} me try to lay aside two other viewpoints which have been prevalent in criticism of Gothic fiction but which strike me as misleading. The first is that the Gothic novel is merely a variation on contemporary fiction of sensibility; the second is that there is an important distinction between novels exploiting terror and those concentrating on horror, between those suggesting the supernatural and those reveling in it. Both ideas have had a near hypnotic attraction for critics, and while I am not denying the facts which have led critics to these conclusions, I question the centrality of such views to our experience of the works. That a novel written during the second half of the eighteenth century was going to be, at least in part, a novel of sensibility is undeniable, but when all the elements of sensibility are removed, we still have a recognizably Gothic fiction. Significantly enough, when Jane Austen wanted to attack sensibility as a preposterous replacement for traditional morality, she wrote Love and Friendship and Lady Susan, but when she wanted to show that the terrors raised in young ladies by an ardent reading of Gothic fiction was no substitute for sexual maturity, she wrote Northanger Abbey. </p>
<p> As for the traditional attempt to distinguish Mrs. Radcliffe's refusal to use real ghosts from Lewis' parade of supernatural figures -- Wandering Jews, Bleeding Nuns, and other domestic visitants, I am not even certain that I agree with Devendra Varma's distinction between terror and horror. He writes: "Terror thus creates an intangible atmosphere of spiritual psychic dread, a certain superstitious shudder at the other world. Horror resorts to a cruder presentation of the macabre: by an exact portrayal of the physically horrible and revolting, against a far more terrible background of spiritual gloom and despair."9 This seems to be merely a distinction based on explicitness, which is a very separate matter from a difference in kind. In the process of commenting on certain aspects of curiosity and compulsion, Angus Fletcher quotes the scene in Plato's Timaeus in which a man, feeling a terrible compulsion to stare at some dead bodies, dismisses his own guilt by blaming his eyes rather than his true self.10 Behind the suggestive terrors of a Mrs. Radcliffe or a Henry James lie the same compulsion to observe the horrible and frightening that is experienced in more explicit descriptions of rotting corpses and bloody vampires. Fletcher's term, "emotive ambivalence," seems too tame to describe this very clear attraction for the terrifying, the disgusting, but it brings us closer to reader response to Gothic fiction than the traditional dichotomy between terror and horror.11 </p>
<p> Roger Caillois' remark on the resemblance between fiction and dream might be helpful here: </p>
<p> The dream remains the common property of the sleeper who has dreamed it {53} and of the waking person who remembers it; in an analogous sense the novel fulfills itself with a mediation between the writer who has created it and the reader who is introduced for a brief instant, for an interlude, as a supernumerary character into a fictional world, no doubt a deceptive and inconsistent world, but a world to which one must resort so long as one delights in literature.12 </p>
<p> While we, as readers, experience the world of Maturin or Mrs. Radcliffe, we are participants in a larger fantasy, and we cannot change the nature of that experience by any belated explanation that a vividly described and experienced monster was merely an illusion. Even the doubts expressed at the moment of such an appearance may merely act to strengthen our experience rather than cause us to "hesitate." Tzvetan Todorov's use of Jan Potoki's powerful Saragossa Manuscript to argue for the viewpoint that the feeling of doubt about whether the ghost is indeed a ghost is the most important structural element in fiction treating the supernatural is entirely unconvincing on this matter of hesitation unless one understands his insistence that he is describing "hollow structures" in a very literal sense.13 </p>
<p> Caillois' analysis of Borges' Circular Ruins as a dream world in which the protagonist is forced to repeat the action of a dreamer having a repeated dream is very close to Fletcher's concept of compulsion and ambivalence and fits Caillois' own definition of the fantastic as something having "le sursaut d'irreducible étrangeté"14 The sense of a fantasy that compels us and from which we have difficulty escaping because we only partly want to escape is one of the central elements that links the Gothic to the grotesque, and while I will have more to say of this, I find it intriguing that in one of Wieland's fairy tales, the justification for dissipating a dream world is that "in this case the reality was so beautiful and extraordinary, that the charms of fiction were superfluous."15 Some of the fairy tales written at the end of the eighteenth century have an intimate connection with the Gothic and differ mainly in the ease with which a normative world of wish fulfillment replaces the compulsive involvement of the Gothic.16 </p>
<p> As for the technical question of the effect of hesitation concerning the involvement of any supernatural agency upon the audience, we must ask ourselves whether, in Lewis' Castle Spectre, Osmond's account of the ghost of Evelina as she appears to him in a dream, "a skeleton, loathsome and meagre" with blood {54} streaming from her bosom, is any the less vivid for being merely a dream and whether, when he tells how her "infected breath was mingled with mine; her rotting fingers pressed my hand, and my face was covered with her kisses," we experience this differently from the supposedly genuine apparition of the Bleeding Nun that Lewis conjures up for the reader in The Monk.17 In that work Raymond, like Osmond, tells how "the spectre pressed her lips to mine, again touched me with her rotting fingers. . . . Far from growing accustomed to the ghost, every succeeding visit inspired me with greater horror."18 Both passages bear Lewis' touch, and both are equally terrifying. What may be at stake in discriminating Mrs. Radcliffe and her followers from the practitioners of the "school of horror" is more likely to be a matter of style and form than any distinction in their presentation of the supernatural. </p>
<p> Mrs. Radcliffe blended Gothic materials with the romance. This is probably more apparent in her earliest work, The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne (1789), which turns, for the most part, on the question of whether Alleyn will be able to marry the high-born Mary, in spite of his seeming low birth. The work is dominated by the typical romance plot rather than by Gothic effects. If Gothic fiction is truly a grotesque mode, the proper plot should be a series of intertwined stories held together by some loose unifying pattern -- the form of that original grotesque scrollwork uncovered in Italy during the late fifteenth century. And, as I will suggest, that was indeed the form for most Gothic fiction written during Mrs. Radcliffe's lifetime. </p>
<p> II </p>
<p> Although many scholars have commented on the attitudes of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries toward the past and particularly toward the middle ages, I am not sure that anyone has argued that, however fascinated they may have been by ancient castles, they tended to regard the past as rude, crude and grotesque -- grotesque in its manners, morals and art. Admittedly the stress in works like Bishop Hurd's Letters on Chivalry and Romance was upon justifying the artistic principles of the middle ages and a similar effort may be found in the attempt to demonstrate the regularity of Chaucer's meter. But the very idea of "an old castle" is enough to send shivers of excitement up Catherine Morland's spine. Since Catherine finds genuine history tiresome, the past which thrills her is the historical past of the Gothic romances -- a time when there was not the "general though unequal mixture of good and bad" to be found in contemporary England but heroes and heroines of extraordinary virtue and villains of the blackest kind.19 </p>
<p> There is a remarkable passage in Radcliffe's The Italian which illustrates thoroughly this odd relation toward the past. Vivaldi and Ellena have just {55} escaped from the Carmelite nunnery, and after passing through some frightening chasms, they come upon a beautiful, pastoral countryside. Nevertheless it is a land which witnessed a tremendous slaughter in Roman times. Radcliffe's comment is curious; though the occurrence of monumental evils might be a part of historical records, such matters were best left unacknowledged by the conscious mind: </p>
<p> "And to such a scene as this," said Vivaldi, "a Roman Emperor came, only for the purpose of witnessing the most barbarous exhibition; to indulge the most savage delights! Here, Claudius celebrated the accomplishment of his arduous work, an aqueduct to carry the overflowing waters of the Celano to Rome, by a naval fight, in which hundreds of wretched slaves perished for his amusement! Its pure and polished surface was stained with human blood, and roughened by the plunging bodies of the slain, while the gilded gallies of the Emperor floated gaily around, and these beautiful shores were made to echo with applauding yells, worthy of the furies!" </p>
<p> "We scarcely dare to trust the truth of history, in some of its traits of human nature," said Ellena.20 </p>
<p> Even allowing for the fact that, as so often, Mrs. Radcliffe has her cake and eats it too by conjuring up a horrible scene and then offering the suggestion that such scenes were not to be thought about, Ellena's sentiments are clearly endorsed by the author as a conscious commentator on the events of the work. </p>
<p> If such horrific moments in history were to be driven from the consciousness, they were clearly to be suppressed in the name of civilization. Volney in his The Ruins (1791) pointed out that even modern warfare was "less sanguinary and less ferocious" than past conflicts.21 But, as I will show later on in this essay, evil is not so easily dismissed. The Italian is the closest of all of Mrs. Radcliffe's novels to having a contemporary setting, and the excitement of the conclusion is generated by the continuation of past institutions of pain and torture into a period proud of its enlightenment. </p>
<p> The vision of the past as conjured up for the readers of the time involved a sense of disorder and the grotesque suggestive of moral evil. Perhaps no one was so clear on this as Shaftesbury, whose Characteristics advocating the relationship between good taste and good morals was the locus classicus of such ideas for the period. In a section of The Philosophical Regimen, Shaftesbury suggested that men attempting to pursue the beautiful should surround themselves with beautiful objects. By so doing it may be possible to create something beautiful "within"; this is contrasted with what is "Gothic or grotesque within" produced by what is grotesque without: {56} </p>
<p> On one side, Gothic architecture, Dutch pictures, Italian farce, Indian music; on the other side, Attic numbers, Ionic and Corinthian orders, and the Greek models in every kind -- Phidias, Appelles, Homer, and Hemskerk, Scarron, Tom D'Urfey. </p>
<p> Compare with the two orders of life -- the rake and vicious, the orderly and good. Or are there no measures, no numbers, or proportion here? nothing like this in life? . . . </p>
<p> Take it in the finest descriptions of vice; take a Petronius. Try. Is this it? does this do? Is it the life of an Encolpius or an Assyltos? Is it the ship of a Tryphon? -- See but how this is in the most debauched authors that copy after nature, that write naturally and ingeniously. Away with these other romances, the women-authors, French gallantry and amours, the modern plays and novels; where there is neither nature nor anything natural so much as lewdness: as those who are wittily lewd see well enough. . . . But for the very real, true nature, and what is according to that nature truly graceful, proportionable, harmonious, and of the higher virtuoso kind; what can it be but virtue itself?22 </p>
<p> In Mrs. Radcliffe's rejection of history there is a parallel to Shaftesbury's rejection of what he calls Locke's "Indian, barbarian stories of wild nations," as being impossible because they controvert his and his era's notion of the way natural man must behave.23 </p>
<p> As for Shaftesbury's coupling of the Gothic and the Grotesque, what may be most significant here is that they are both associated with vice and disorder. The follies of the past, whether in architecture, gardening or morals, are reduced to a deviation from harmony and right morals. For Catherine Morland to find herself loving Gothic romances and old castles, with their ghosts, gargoyles and rattling chains, is more than a mild error in taste. When she carries her fantasies from fiction to life, her actions are equivalent to a deviation into a grotesque form of behavior. No wonder Henry's lecture is enough to make her realize her folly. The world conjured up by Henry Tilney may not follow virtue or beauty in Shaftesbury's sense of these terms, but he assures Catherine that it will not tolerate any major detour from law and common sense. </p>
<p> Having so often experienced the idea of the magical force from the past, modern readers might view it as a cliché, though in a motion picture like Fritz Lang's Metropolis, the ancient wizard's shack in the midst of modern skyscrapers, which have been constructed through the magical powers operating from the shack, can still function as a powerful symbol. Similar effects in Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist show that, however overused, they can still move an audience. But in Frankenstein it assumes an important role for the first time. We tend to think of the monster as the product of technology which has not sufficient controls to harness the destructive forces unleashed. But Mary Shelley's hero enters {57} medical school a disciple of the ancient alchemists, and his dreams are their dreams: </p>
<p> . . . I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly found. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.24 </p>
<p> He absorbs modern scientific techniques but never abandons the desire to return to his "ancient studies" in order to search after solutions to matters of immortality. And Frankenstein is careful to point out that his passionate and imaginative longing after the creation of the monster is far closer to the feelings that motivated the alchemists than the calm search after knowledge that ought to distinguish the scientist. Among the many themes that emerge in Frankenstein, the distorted longing after unnatural powers is not the least. And the grotesque monster is the product. </p>
<p> As for history itself, unless we are aware of the sense in which the past seemed genuinely evil, we will misunderstand Sir Walter Scott's contribution to fiction. He was praised for making the past available by showing historical figures as having that "general though unequal mixture of good and bad" which Austen accepts as the nature of contemporary humanity. If we insist that the past was really very different and that Scott's view was a falsification, we miss the point. By falsifying the past he made it available to his audience. The Gothic villain may be closer to historical and psychological reality, but just as he was, for the most part, the creation of those "women-authors" Shaftesbury attacked, so he was consigned to the arena of romance by the Henry Tilney's of the world and roundly condemned by Coleridge as the participant in a type of fiction worse than the "annals of a brothel."25 </p>
<p> III </p>
<p> I want to turn now to a consideration of the grotesque in the Gothic. For the most part, I will use this word in the sense of the broad categories employed by Wolfgang Kayser, making particular use of two of the four major definitions he provides: the grotesque as "THE ESTRANGED WORLD," and the grotesque as "AN ATTEMPT TO INVOKE AND SUBDUE THE DEMONIC ASPECTS OF THE WORLD."26 Since I want to avoid the larger philosophic problems, I will also use Ruskin's very practical division of the grotesque into the serious and the playful, the moral and the decorative. The weakness (and to some extent the strength) of Kayser's effort at definition is that it attempts to be all-encompassing. {58} For example, he strives to bring together what the eighteenth century knew as "comic grotesque" in its pantomimes with more psychologically disturbing aspects. Doubtless there are elements of terror behind the grimaces of a Harlequin, but Ruskin was right to separate the two types of grotesque, which, parallel to the "separation of styles" remarked by Auerbach, persists in the division between the clowning of the servants and the disturbing psychological involvements of their masters.27 The grotesque that appears in picaresque fiction and in satire is mainly comic in nature. Hence the distinction between works like Smollett's Ferdinand Count Fathom and the Gothic, for however much the scene in that work involving a mysterious inn, a dead body, and a band of banditti might fit into a Gothic novel, we never forget that Ferdinand is a rogue toward whose antics the reader feels a sense of superiority. </p>
<p> The grotesque of the Gothic is more closely related to what Wieland called "grotesque in the proper sense," the end result of which is likely to be disgust rather than laughter.28 The demons of the Gothic -- real, imagined, or fabricated -- represent a sudden revelation of the uncontrolled forces of the mind as they are reified in the seemingly ordered, real world. In The Italian, the sudden revelation of the continuing existence of the Catholic Inquisition with its instruments of torture, its odd rituals and its threat to the normal in the world of the Italian Enlightenment is far more symptomatic of the Gothic mode than any puzzling over the reality or unreality of demons and ghosts. Much of The Italian is filled with the Neapolitan sunlight, which finds its intellectual and human counterpart in Vivaldi's speeches on civil liberties and justice. More than any other element in The Italian the presence of human evil -- a Schedoni, a group of torturers -- gives the twist to the work that makes us think of it as Gothic and grotesque. </p>
<p> The grotesque twist I speak of is best expressed in Schedoni's symbolic motions as, stalking Ellena along the beach, he moves before and about her like a cowardly beast of prey. Her first reaction is to approach him for help, but she soon discovers that his glance which seemed at first ambiguous, then "sly," is, when fully revealed, terrifying.29 Like the twisted pattern of the grotesque scroll work with its braid of snakes, lizards and monstrous forms, the impression is, at first, relatively light and, finally, sinister; like the brutal battles of the past, the grotesque suggests an underlying reality that ought not be confronted too often if we are to preserve our belief in civilized values. </p>
<p> If we keep these ideas in mind, Horace Walpole's attack on Clara Reeve's Old English Baron as "insipid" is hardly surprising. In spite of his depreciating comments on his own The Castle of Otranto, he did not feel that Reeve's attempt {59} to bring probability to the "gothic Tale" was a step in the right direction.30 Yet even Reeve does little to change the general effect of the Gothic, an effect built into what Mrs. Radcliffe was to call the "grotesque beauty" of the landscape and atmosphere.31 In Gothic fiction, character is inseparable from scene. Madame Montoni of The Mysteries of Udolpho only assumes her Gothic role when she ceases to be the Burneyesque Mlle. Cheron and becomes the archetypal victim of what, for want of a better term, I will call the grotesque villain -- the character who represents will and power in Gothic fiction. The secret passageways, caves and grottoes introduced into Gothic fiction by Walpole do not function merely as setting. They evoke the world of psychological terror as surely as, for the romances, a bank of jasmines in an arbor evoked the world of love.32 </p>
<p> For example, when, in Mrs. Radcliffe's A Sicilian Romance, an old castle stairway crumbles beneath the feet of Ferdinand (one of two heroic young men in the work), what is evoked is the sensation of dreams -- or nightmare rather -- in which some object we are grasping, that keeps us from falling into an abyss, crumbles in our hands.33 A similar scene was rendered by William Beckford some years later as, in a cross between a travel book and a collection of visionary experiences, he described the sensation of seeming inevitably to slip into a chasm without any possibility of being able to control the motion.34 Herbert Read was right to compare the Gothic with surrealism; though the visual landscape of Dali's and Chirico's denuded plains is the very opposite of the picturesque Gothic landscape, both share the feeling of unreality we associate with dreams.35 </p>
<p> The connection between landscape and the Gothic is familiar enough, but discussions on this subject have been tied much too closely to Edmund Burke's theories on sublimity. Because Burke believed that almost everything capable of producing terror was an aspect of the sublime, he failed to distinguish between the sublime and the grotesque.36 Sublime landscapes abound in the Gothic, {60} but they are incidental to the form. Rousseau's Eloisa is certainly not a Gothic novel, yet it too is filled with sublime scenes of the mountains of Europe. What Burke provided was an explanation for our attraction to scenes of distress. His arguments, that "we have a degree of delight . . . in the real misfortunes and pains of others," and that our sense of delight comes from a feeling of relief from sympathetically experienced pain rather than our distance from it, provided one level of psychology used by writers of Gothic fiction.37 </p>
<p> Burke's explanation was not entirely original. For example, take the scene in The Mysteries of Udolpho in which Blanche, from the safety of a comfortable room in a monastery, experiences a certain excitement in observing a ship endangered by a Mediterranean storm.38 This is merely a reenactment of what has been called the "Lucretian return," from a scene of a shipwreck in Lucretius' De rerum natura in which the Roman poet explained the pleasure felt at a sudden awareness of our own safety in watching the distress of others. (It was one of the common explanations for the ability of audiences to sit through tragedies like Oedipus and Lear.)39 But Burke provided a new insight into the "pleasure" afforded by this experience, as a glance at similar shipwreck passages in Robinson Crusoe will demonstrate, for the involvement that Blanche feels in watching this scene of distress suggests ambivalence -- not the direct concern of a Crusoe, but a conscious thrill that goes far beyond the pity and anxiety she feels for the safety of the passengers. </p>
<p> Such a scene draws upon Burke's theories for its effects and demonstrates the degree to which the admiration for the sublime influenced Gothic fiction, but as I have already argued, the sublime influenced the fiction of sensibility as well. If we are seeking the essential Gothic effect it will not be in the landscapes of Mrs. Radcliffe's The Romance of the Forest; as with her romance plots, this is an intermixture. This same intermixture appears frequently in Gothic drama. In arguing that Burke's theories on the sublime "read like a text on how to write a Gothic drama," Pamela Kaufman fails to distinguish those aspects which this drama shared with the "she-tragedy" of the period and those which were distinctively Gothic.40 Even the themes of incest which she finds central to the Gothic drama were part of the heritage that eighteenth-century tragedy owed the Restoration. If the Oedipus of Dryden and Lee and Dryden's Don Sebastian were no longer performed, they were still read, and Otway's The Orphan retained its popularity on the stage. Walpole's debt to these writers in The Mysterious Mother is far more obvious than any debt he owed to previous fiction in writing The Castle of Otranto. </p>
<p> If we wish to find a pure Gothic effect, we should examine the familiar scenes from The Mysteries of Udolpho in which on two occasions Emily, the heroine, {61} opens mysterious veils. Mrs. Radcliffe is still using the language of the sublime, but the intention is clearly different: </p>
<p> This brought to her recollection the veiled picture, which had attracted her curiosity, on the preceding night, and she resolved to examine it. As she passed through the chambers, that led to this, she found herself somewhat agitated; its connection with the late lady of the castle, and the conversation of Annette, together with the circumstance of the veil, throwing a mystery over the subject, that excited a faint degree of terror. But a terror of this nature, as it occupies and expands the mind, and elevates it to high expectation, is purely sublime, and leads us, by a kind of fascination, to seek even the object, from which we appear to shrink.41 </p>
<p> Though Radcliffe asks the reader to think of the sublime, this is not an experience which a reading of Burke will easily clarify. Like the sublime, the experience has the effect of suspending time. "Horror," says Radcliffe, "occupied her mind, and excluded, for a time, all sense of past, and dread of future misfortune. . . ."42 But if the sublime does indeed expand and elevate the mind, the kind of horror experienced by Emily is closer to the physical sensation we experience when an elevator seems to move up and down at the same time than to the spiritual pleasures of sublimity. </p>
<p> The reader does not learn what Emily observed until the end of the novel, when the vision is revealed as a wax image of a figure dressed for the grave, covered with worms, but Mrs. Radcliffe heightens the horrific effect by having Emily's thoughts dwell on the scene with anxiety and by establishing a parallel scene shortly thereafter. Once more there is a curtain to be drawn, and the reader is kept in suspense through an analysis of Emily's "fit of desperation" just before drawing the veil. The scene satisfies her expectation: </p>
<p> Beyond, appeared a corpse, stretched on a kind of low couch, which was crimsoned with human blood, as was the floor beneath. The features, deformed by death, were ghastly and horrible, and more than one livid wound appeared in the face. Emily, bending over the body, gazed, for a moment, with an eager, frenzied eye; but, in the next, the lamp dropped from her hand, and she fell senseless at the foot of the couch.43 </p>
<p> In considering this fascination for death and the horrible, we might go back to the scene from Plato's Timaeus, but a glance at some of the reactions of a contemporary of Mrs. Radcliffe, James Boswell, might be more satisfying from an {62} historical standpoint. In his Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, Boswell comments on a similar fascination: </p>
<p> By the road I had, from that strange curiosity which I always have about anything dismal, stepped out of the chaise and run up close to the gallows where Kenneth Leal hangs in chains for robbing the mail. As he had not hung but above two months, the body was quite entire. It was still a man hanging. The sight impressed me with a degree of gloom. Mr. Johnson did not know of this, or, he told me afterwards, he would not have talked as he did, for he diverted himself with trying to frighten me, as if the witches would come and dance at the foot of my bed.44 </p>
<p> Shades of The Saragossa Manuscript -- hanging man, witches and all! But, as we shall see, the key word here is "curiosity." </p>
<p> What I want to establish at this point is that characters in a Gothic novel are undergoing an experience from which they will not easily recover. When Leslie Fiedler slips into the phrase, "a betrayal of pity and terror"45 to describe what he considers the hoax that Radcliffe plays on the reader by her efforts to dispel any notion that she really believes in the supernatural, he is falling into the same trap Mrs. Radcliffe made for herself -- to try to convince the reader that in spite of the Schedoni's, Montonis, and Malcolms, we are to believe "that those who do only which is right, endure nothing in misfortune but a trial of their virtue, and from trials well endured, derive the surest claim to the protection of heaven."46 Mrs. Radcliffe knew better, and her novels tell a different story until the very end. That the demons working in the palace of the Inquisition are human does not make their impact any less terrifying. When the reader discovers that supernatural evil is mainly a metaphor for human evil, he hardly learns anything very comforting. </p>
<p> IV </p>
<p> I have previously suggested that Montoni was a grotesque villain on the grounds that, during the Restoration and eighteenth century, evil was replaced, in part, by concepts of deformity and the grotesque. Peter Thorslev, in his study, The Byronic Hero, suggested that the origins of the heroic image created by and associated with Byron might be found, among other places, in Walpole's Manfred, the villain of the first Gothic novel.47 But Manfred's own pedigree may be traced directly to the heroic plays of Dryden and particularly to the character of Maximin, the powerful, God-defying Emperor of Rome, who came to the throne after murdering Titus. By a seemingly deliberate misunderstanding of Corneille's {63} gloire, Dryden provided his protagonist eccentricity in his vices instead of the individuality in virtue usually associated with gloire, and in spite of his title, and his massive strength, he undercut his dignity by leaving him some of the clownishness of the barbarian hordes from whom he was descended. </p>
<p> Dryden drew many interesting characters, but few so fascinating as this "deformed piece," who dies still asserting his will by thrusting his dagger upward against the Gods. Working through a process of contrast, Dryden set Maximin alongside Saint Catharine, the Christian ideal of perfect chastity and faith, and though intermediary characters blur the starkness of this antithesis, it is always present. Adding to the polarization of the characters is the attraction that Maximin feels for Saint Catharine -- an attraction composed of a mixture of awe and the desire of human evil to possess and thereby destroy the good. Jean Hagstrum has shown how thoroughly Dryden was intrigued by the grotesque as a mode of characterization, and surely Maximin is the most interesting of his grotesques.48 Actually a mixture between an Alani and a Goth (in Dryden's play between an Alani and a Thracian), Maximin, like his literary descendant, Shelley's Zastrozzi, bears some taint in his blood that twists and distorts whatever virtues he has.49 </p>
<p> This distortion is the product of the sway of the passions and the will over the reason. If we turn to the icon of "Terror" in Cesare Ripa's Iconologia, we will find a graphic example of the association of violent fear with the grotesque. Terror itself is a grotesque figure with the body of a man and the head of a lion. The commentary describes the significance of the symbols: </p>
<p> The Whip, an instrument used to force others to do one's will, presents the terror caused by pain and violence, and by the apparent success of evil. The changing colors of the robe symbolize the inexplicable changes in life which are so frightening, but also the various passions which race through the soul of the terrified.50 </p>
<p> Behind the figure of the personification of terror is a scene depicting the banquet of the Emperor Domitian in which hanging skulls and other human parts are intended to fill the guests with terror. Domitian, whose complete power enables him to play with his guests' emotions, looks on with amusement. </p>
<p> Domitian, unlike Maximin, is a genuine Roman Emperor rather than a usurper, but we find the same kind of pattern -- the use of power to cause pain, the delight in torture, the deliberate attempt to terrify -- as may be found in Mrs. Radcliffe's Montoni, who, we are told, "delighted in the energies of the passions."51 The same force of character may be found even earlier in the century in Thomas {64} Leland's Reginald, the villain of Longsword, Earl of Salisbury (1762), whose face reveals the presence of uncontrolled passions and who therefore provokes feelings of disgust from those around him. The disgust is felt for both the "malignant" and "sensual" passions, and just as Maximin desires to possess Catharine physically, so behind the threatening aspect of the Gothic hero-villain is the continual threat of sexual violation. When Emily asks Montoni by what right he thinks he can control her actions, he replies "with a malicious smile, 'by the right of my will.'"52 His cruelty, his willingness to destroy a helpless enemy, presents a disturbing vision of evil in the world -- a world which, at other times, seems beautiful or even sublime. Just as the sunshine of southern France and La Vallée is representative of the ordinary world of Emily, so the mouldering and "grotesque" Udolpho is the true seat of Montoni.53 Sir Walter Scott rightly remarked that Radcliffe's characters "are in some sort as fabulous as fairies or ogres."54 </p>
<p> Characters like Montoni, the strange portraits that somehow appear to resemble the seemingly unconnected hero or heroine, the appearances of skeletons and bloody corpses, the dungeons filled with grotesque snakes are all signs that lead us into the world that Freud called that of "the uncanny," a world in which we feel continually disturbed and alienated.55 And it is not the appearance of a skeleton so much as our expectation of it that leaves us anxious and unhinged, that puts us into that state of discomfort -- that state which is a strange blend of fascination and disgust -- we associate with the grotesque. </p>
<p> V </p>
<p> We should realize that Gothic fiction came into being at a time when the world of dreams and imagination were highly suspect. Bad dreams might be explained in any number of ways, including some perfectly sensible ideas on the influence of diet and the position of the sleeper, but Andrew Baxter was still arguing near the middle of the century that the only alternative to his notion that dreams were the product of visiting spirits was that "the soul is mad every night, and that awakening in the morning cures it again of its phrensy."56 Baxter, of course, {65} opts for the influence of spiritual forces: "How delightful is it to think that there is a world of spirits; that we are surrounded with intelligent living Beings, rather than in a lonely, unconscious Universe, a wilderness of matter! It is a pledge of immortality itself."57 Comforting as this thought might be, the nightmare, during which victims were supposed to feel overwhelmed by an enormous weight, might well be the product of an evil spirit, and if the Gothic might be thought of as being close to the literature of fantasy and dream, it is the world of nightmare to which we must address ourselves. </p>
<p> Thus the experience which Mrs. Radcliffe calls "curiosity" is a complex of feelings involving a sense of unreality, a fear of approaching terror, and an attraction for it. If these feelings have some link to sexuality, which also involves a mixture of attraction and repulsion, they are present in the nightmare as well. Fuseli was right to render his Nightmare in symbolically sexual terms.58 Mrs. Radcliffe's heroines tremble with that curiosity and terror, which makes them "seek even the object from which . . . [they] appear to shrink"; and so do the men. As La Motte in The Romance of the Forest opens a trunk and discovers a skeleton, he feels that "thrilling curiosity which objects of terror often excite in the human mind," and he feels impelled to take a second look.59 Although we may find some basis in Burke for this emotion, as moderns, we are likely to be more satisfied with a comparison to the emotions that Freud found in scopophilia -- a pleasure accompanied by fear and disgust. </p>
<p> Considerable comment on "curiosity" may be found in the literature of the time. In speaking of the effect of the grotesque Chinese garden, Sir William Chambers argued that by varying the visual experience "from places of horror to scenes of delight," by even using "repeated shocks of electrical impulse," one could subject the spectator to an almost unnatural excitement. The result is that "his attention is constantly kept up, his curiosity excited, and his mind agitated by a great variety of opposite passions."60 And Uvedale Price complained that in the landscapes which lack the picturesque "curiosity, that most active principle {66} of pleasure, is almost extinguished."61 Price carefully distinguished what he calls the "picturesque" from the sublime on the grounds that the sublime was based entirely on feelings of "awe and terror" whereas the picturesque may contain the "light and playful" as well as the awesome. Applying this to mountain scenery which was often considered part of the sublime, he remarks: </p>
<p> Those who have felt the excitement produced by the intricasies of wild romantic mountain scenes, can tell how curiosity, while it prompts us to scale every rocky promontory, to explore every new recess by its active agency keeps the fibres to their full tone; and thus picturesqueness when mixed with either of the other characters, corrupts the langour of beauty, or the tension of sublimity.62 </p>
<p> All of this adds up to the effect that Sir Walter Scott saw in Mrs. Radcliffe, an effect of "awakened curiosity and suspended interest."63 </p>
<p> If Gothic fiction resembled Price's ideal landscape in arousing curiosity and in being grotesque, and picturesque, or rather ambivalently picturesque, to adopt Fletcher's term, the structure of Gothic fiction should follow this pattern as well. It should be essentially semi-circular, twisting, repetitive, open-ended. Although contemporary fiction tended to insist on closed endings, the tradition was not so strong as it later became in the nineteenth century, and those great models of comic grotesque, Gargantua and Pantagruel, A Tale of a Tub, and Tristram Shandy had set an important precedent for open-endedness. In Gothic fiction, as I have previously suggested, examples of this type are easy to find. In fact, a study of the description appended to titles during the high point of Gothic fiction reveals that the most popular name was "a tale," which, as opposed to titles like "romance" or "novel," usually indicated a number of tales woven into a larger framework.64 Maturin's Melmoth the Wanderer has an ending imposed upon it that is arbitrary and unconvincing, while Jan Potocki's The Saragossa Manuscript, in which all stories seem to be part of a single story with infinite variations and in which any linear progress toward an end is interrupted by repeated visions, gives an even better example of grotesque form in the Gothic. </p>
<p> Of course Mary Shelley's Frankenstein has an ending of a kind (Whatever does happen to the Monster?), but the first stage version in 1826 had already moved the locale to volcanic Italy and provided a scenario similar to the Hollywood version of the story.65 All of which suggests the impossibility of imposing {67} an ending on such an archetypal story. Roger Caillois remarks, "The impact of the dream is that it demands an explanation, a sequel, and, almost, a realization. Whenever it enters competition with reality, it is the dream that wins. . . ."66 The return of Frankenstein's monster may appear to be the creation of a producer trying to make a few dollars on a sure winner, but the public is willing to come because in their collective psyches, they know that the monster cannot die. No more can the grotesque form of Gothic fiction be successfully closed. </p>
<p> At the beginning of this essay I noted Kayser's reservations about the word, "grotesque." He also confessed to the lack of a "wholehearted enthusiasm for the subject."67 Even allowing that the "curiosity" of which Price and Mrs. Radcliffe speak so highly is somewhat different from the quality that E. M. Forster described as "the lowest and simplest of literary organisms" and as a "literary tool" fit for "tyrants and savages," we might question whether Gothic fiction deserves the revival it appears to be experiencing today.68 I think that there is some parallelism between sentimentalism and the Gothic. It is easy enough to make a reader cry, but that does not make a work good in itself, as an eighteenth-century reader might have thought, or bad in itself, as a reader in the first half of the twentieth century might have thought. We have to accept the grotesque machinery -- the skeleton that is shaken before us, the gloomy castle, and the brooding villain -- for the bag of tricks they are; we have to agree with Henry Tilney that Gothic fiction is a grotesque distortion of anything resembling ordinary life; finally, we must acknowledge that they move us nonetheless, that they are deeply disturbing and compelling at the same time. In the hands of an Eliza Parsons the machinery is hardly sufficient to sustain interest, much less to be regarded as literature. But the accomplishments of a Mrs. Radcliffe, a Lewis, a Maturin and an Emily Brontë lay within the limits of the mode of Gothic fiction, and their achievements are well worth reading and studying. </p>
<p> Notes </p>
<p> 1. The Novels of Jane Austen, ed. R: W. Chapman (Oxford: Clarendon, 1948), V, 111. This is the comment of Jane Austen as narrator. When Henry speaks for himself, he uses terms like "Open, candid, artless, guileless." See V, 206. </p>
<p> 3. On the simplest level it may be said that the rendering of skeletons, demons, witches and ghosts, from ancient times to the present, qualifies automatically as grotesque. </p>

<p> 8. The Grotesque in Art and Literature, trans. Ulrich Weisstein (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1966), p. 17. Arthur Clayborough dismisses "Gothic" materials as too "hackneyed and conventional" to be properly grotesque, but his real reason for avoiding the subject appears to be less the aesthetic argument that whatever is familiar cannot be grotesque than his desire to treat major authors. The section on Coleridge, for example, is well done, but the centrality of such a discussion in a book on the grotesque is questionable. See The Grotesque in English Literature (Oxford: Clarendon, 1965), p. 160 ff. </p>
<p> 9. The Gothic Flame (London: Barker, 1957), p. 130. I am not questioning the historical basis for this distinction. Mrs. Radcliffe, herself, wrestled with it, and it was a commonplace subject in any discussion of sublimity; but there is no question that modern critics have found the terms inexact. See Ann Radcliffe, "On the Supernatural in Poetry," New Monthly Magazine, 16 (1826), part I, 147-48; and Peter Penzoldt, The Supernatural in Fiction (London: Peter Nevill, 1952), pp. 9-10. </p>

<p> 13. See The Fantastic, trans. Richard Howard (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1975), p. 94. I doubt if Todorov would have considered the question of the validity of the supernatural as a vital structure if it had not been a concern of late eighteenth-century criticism. Mrs. Radcliffe and other writers of Gothic fiction were genuinely concerned that they would be thought to be propagating "superstition" in an age of enlightenment. See "On the Supernatural," p. 148. </p>

<p> 16. Peter Haining's inclusion of rewritten legends and fairy tales in his Penguin anthology, Gothic Tales of Terror, is an excellent way of pointing out this relationship. Todorov's insistence (Fantastic, pp. 54, 64-65) that we recognize fairy tales as unreal from the first sentence seems tenuous to me.

<p> 27. Erich Auerbach, Mimesis, trans. Willard Trask (New York: Doubleday, 1957), pp. 274-78, 290-91. Comic servants were part of Gothic fiction from the time of Walpole, who claimed Shakespeare's plays as a precedent, and William Beckford's Modern Novel Writing (ed. Herman Levy Jr. [Gainesville: Scholar's Facsimiles, 1970], pp. 39-40), written in 1797, has a good parody of this convention. What is more interesting is the degree of comedy in the adventures of characters from the upper and middle classes. James Hogg's Gil Martin, the satanic figure of Confessions of a Justified Sinner, brings into all his actions some of the antics which were expected from devils in Elizabethan drama, and even Mrs. Radcliffe will occasionally place her heroines in a comic light. </p>

<p> 32. For a brief discussion of romance landscape, see my "Some Notes Toward a History of Fictional Forms," Novel, 6 (1973), 125. If the novels of the eighteenth century lacked a rich landscape, this was certainly not true of the romances and short novels of the seventeenth century which were still in circulation and occasionally reprinted. Although Mrs. Radcliffe's descriptions are somewhat more individualized, they are still aimed at producing certain limited affects of surprise or wonder and tend toward stereotypes of pastoral or sublime scenes. </p>

For a well documented but somewhat uncritical examination of this problem, see Malcolm Ware, Sublimity in the Novels of Ann Radcliffe, Upsala Essays and Studies on English Literature No. 25 (Upsala: A. B. Lundequistska Bokhandeln, 1965). The distinction between terror (sublime) and horror (grotesque) often served in the place of a working definition of the grotesque. Wordsworth argued that when the mind was possessed with "personal fear," what is produced is merely "fear and degradation," and he noted how easily the sublime could slip into the grotesque -- a mixture of the "terrible and the ludicrous."

In a letter dated 18 January 1787, William Cowper expressed what was still the attitude of religious believers at the time: </p>
<p> I have a mind, my dear, (and to you I will venture to boast of it) as free from superstition as any man living, neither do I give heed to dreams in general as predictive, though particular dreams I believe to be so. Some very sensible persons, and I suppose Mrs. Carter among them, will acknowledge that in old times God spoke by dreams, but affirm with much boldness that he has since ceased to do so. If you ask them why? they answer, because he has now revealed his will in the Scripture, and there is no longer any need that he should instruct or admonish us by dreams. I grant that with respect to doctrines and precepts he has left us in want of nothing; but has he thereby precluded himself in any of the operations of his Providence? Surely not. It is perfectly a different consideration; and the same need that there ever was of his interference in this way, there is still, and ever must be, while man continues blind and fallible, and a creature beset with dangers which he can neither forsee nor obviate. His operations however of this kind are, I allow, very rare; and as to the generality of dreams, they are made of such stuff, and are in themselves so insignificant, that though I believe them all to be the manufacture of others, not our own, I account it not a farthing-matter who manufactures them. So much for dreams! </p>
<p> Maurice Lévy, who has some excellent comments on the way imaginative terror of literature may replace a genuine horror of the supernatural, underestimates both the degree of religious belief in England (un climat de totale incrédulité) and the distance that men like Horace Walpole were removed from such beliefs. See William Cowper, Life and Works, ed. Robert Southey (London: Baldwin & Cradock, 1836), VI, 52-53; and Levy, Le Roman "Gothique" Anglais 1764-1824 (Toulouse: Faculté des Lettres et Sciences Humaines, 1968), p. 618. </p>

Unit Rationale:
The Grotesque of the Gothic: From Poe to the Present

“Gothic” or “Goth” is a term still used today, but where did it come from? What does
Gothic really mean? Why does dressing “Goth” imply wearing all or mostly black? And why are
spooky images associated with both? Edgar Allen Poe had a lot to do with this. The Gothic
genre, though having originated in England, was brought to America by Poe and the literary
culture as we then knew it was transformed. This four-week unit is designed to outline for
students the historical background of the Gothic, including biographical information on Poe’s
life. Students will examine and analyze how the Gothic has changed from Poe’s time until now,
and wrestle with questions such as “what is attractive about the emotional experience of fear”? In
other words, “why do you enjoy scary movies?”
Gothic (or gothick), a term originally used to describe that which was barbaric or
barbarian, comes from the word Goth, the name of the Germanic tribes who destroyed Rome and
wreaked havoc on the rest of Europe in the third through fifth centuries. Later, because of the
architecture that flourished in Europe during the Middle Ages known for its non-classical style,
the term Gothic came to take on other meanings, synonymous with Middle Ages and medieval.
Originally, this style of architecture was frowned upon as it was once thought ugly, stemming
from the barbarous Germanic tribes who attacked much of Europe in the earlier centuries, but by
the nineteenth century, there was a resurgence of the Gothic style, an appreciation of that which
invoked the imagination and the sublime. In fact, as a precursor to Romanticism, its flying

The Grotesque of the Gothic

Phillips 3

buttresses, pointed arches, stained glass windows, upward movement and varied intricacies were
believed to “suggest heavenward aspiration” (academic.brooklyn.edu).
As a result of this Gothic resurgence in architecture, Horace Walpole rebuilt his
Strawberry Hill estate in London in pure Gothic style as a medieval castle. His first novel, The
Castle of Otranto, was published in 1764 and became an immediate success. The work was
quickly popularized by other writers who tried to imitate his style; it wasn’t long before the
Gothic was a distinguishable genre, with The Castle of Otranto being the first of its kind.
The Gothic genre has evolved from the late 1700s to the twenty-first century, to include
sub-genres such as Southern Gothic and New American Gothic, but similarities remain. In
general, what makes a work distinctly Gothic is some combination of the following elements:
 Castles or old, decrepit houses, could be haunted
 Dungeons, subterranean passageways, basements, attics
 Dark corridors, winding stairways
 Flickering lights, candles, moonlight
 Extreme landscapes
 omens or curses
 maidens in distress
 villain or madmen
 magic or supernatural manifestations
These writings create feelings of gloom, mystery, terror, suspense and fear as they seek to
explore humanity’s dark side and arouse questions in mankind about good vs. evil, the role of the
supernatural, the experience of fear or terror, and others.

The Grotesque of the Gothic

Phillips 4

Though parodies of the Gothic were written and Romantic poets gained popularity, their
writings actually contributed to the growth of the Gothic fiction or, what could now be called,
Gothic romance. In America, a young man by the name of Edgar Allen Poe was reading the
works of Ann Radcliffe, Lord Byron, and Charles Dickens, all the while being influenced to
bring the Gothic genre to America. And in fact he did.
Edgar Allen Poe is credited with transforming America’s literary scene by introducing his
own countrymen to tales of the macabre. The tragic affairs of his personal life seem to haunt
each of his writings. From poverty to an absent father, to gambling, to drunken binges late at
night, Edgar Allen Poe suffered a genius too great for even him to bear. After losing three
beloved women to tuberculosis, he knew personally what it meant to suffer the loss of a loved
one, these losses affecting him psychologically as well as emotionally. This “terror of the soul,”
as he called it, surfaced in his writings which his contemporaries could not master nor
understand. After having compiled his works in a single book, the publisher of Doubleday had
this to say:
Among the great masters of the short story, Edgar Allen Poe retains his
preeminence even after a century. Ligeia, The Tell-Tale Heart, The Fall of the
House of Usher, The Masque of the Red Death, and The Cask of Amontillado,
brought the suspense story to a point of artistic perfection not since surpassed.
Every sentence carries the reader irresistibly toward a climax that continues to
build to the last line, even the final word….Taken together, Poe’s short stories
comprise one of the half dozen great works of literature by an American writer,
and his verse—slender volume though it is—forms a unique and rich contribution
to the poetry of the English language (Complete, inside cover).

The Grotesque of the Gothic

Phillips 5

It is this “point of artistic perfection” to which I would like to expose students through this unit
on Poe.
In American Literature, students generally cover the literature chronologically. With
Poe’s significant contributions to America’s literary culture, contributions that are still witnessed
today, the eleventh grade student ought to learn more about his life, his work and his lasting
impact on today’s writings than what is currently practiced.
After students have gained a firm understanding of what the term Gothic means, and its
origin, they will be expected to learn all elements that define typical Gothic literature. We will
briefly discuss Poe’s life and the biographical aspects that most influenced his writings. Students
will examine a variety of texts ranging from Poe to the present day. Students will respond in a
variety of ways to include journal entries, small and large group discussions, visual art creation
such as a collage that depicts a Poe piece, and a found poem that captures the essence of what
Poe was trying to say through one of his writings.
As mentioned previously, the Gothic literature of Poe’s time spawned new genres known
as Southern Gothic and New American Gothic. Therefore, students will have the opportunity to
examine texts from each of these genres and draw comparisons to Poe’s original. Texts for
examination include: The Fall of the House of Usher, The Raven, The Masque of the Red Death
(film-Vincent Price), A Rose for Emily by Faulkner, The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley
Jackson, Interview with a Vampire by Anne Rice, and The Museum of Dr. Moses: Tales of
Mystery and Suspense by Joyce Carol Oates. We will ‘read’ the first three as a class, but the last
four texts will be listed as choices for literature circles. (The Turn of the Screw by Henry James
and Northanger Abbey by Jane Austen will be optional texts in the event the Jackson’s book is
not approved.) Students will be divided into groups of 4-5 and given a choice of the

The Grotesque of the Gothic

Phillips 6

aforementioned books. At the end of the unit, each group will be asked to present their book to
the class in some form or fashion as one summative assessment of what they have learned.
I agree with Alsup and Bush that asking students to engage with various texts (short
story, poem, film and novel) that stretch across an expanse of time will “provide students the
opportunity to read contemporary as well as classic literature through theoretical lenses and to
engage in intertextual comparisons” (Alsup and Bush, 9). Students will analyze each of the Poe
pieces and participate in written responses to various questions posed by the teacher. One
question in particular students will be asked to think through is: “How does terror differ from
horror?” Students will record their thoughts as a journal entry prior to large and/or small group
discussion. Vocabulary studies will also come from the texts, as this is a direct correlation to
what Applebee calls knowledge in action.
Considering what objections may arise, some students may be more sensitive to fear and
suspense than others. The classic Gothic fiction has evolved into a horror novel of sorts with
authors like Stephen King at the forefront. I would never want a student to be uncomfortable. At
the same time, most high school students I know are watching horror films. There is a mysterious
appeal to this genre of film and literature because it has been a success for well over a century. In
response to concerns such as this, I’ve included a variety of texts for the literature circle portion
of the unit that allows some choice in what the student reads. These texts range from mild to
frightening in terms of their level of emotional response. I do not foresee any problematic
concerns with the Poe portion of the unit. The fact that this genre has spanned two centuries
speaks for its enduring value and literary significance. I look forward to a thrilling four-week
unit that engages readers in the literature and life of the mysteries of Edgar Allen Poe and
beyond.

Overarching Unit Goals:
The Grotesque of the Gothic: From Poe to the Present

1. Students will keep a Reading Log for the duration of this unit. “The Fall of the House of
Usher” will already be broken up into a “Quotes and Notes” format so students are able
to annotate the text as they read. This should help in the transferring of notes or questions
to the reading log. The reading log will serve to further support this idea of capturing
one’s thoughts, questions, and feelings about the literature and classroom discussions
through writing. “The purpose of these journals is to encourage students to attend
carefully to the language of the literature and to read reflectively, pausing to think about
particular passages” (Smagorinsky 125). Students will also be asked questions
occasionally in class in which they are directed to ponder and record their thoughts in
their log. Reading logs will be collected every other Friday and will be graded on a
pass/fail basis. *See Reading Log Rubric for further details and expectations.

2. Students will participate in one of four possible literature circles. Ms Phillips will present
the texts available and students will vote secretly on their top two choices. After all votes
have been tallied, groups will be formed with four or five students in each group. Each
student will serve in one of the following roles: Discussion Director, Investigator,
Connector, Literary Luminator, and/or Illustrator. The purpose of this activity is for
students to help other students understand, question, respond, connect, and consider other
viewpoints concerning the literature. The groups will meet twice per week while they’re
reading the assigned book and have additional time in class to plan their book

The Grotesque of the Gothic

Phillips 9

presentation once the book has been finished. Presentation should include a poster that
somehow depicts the novel or short stories students have been reading. Texts for
Literature Circles include the following:
a. “A Rose for Emily,” Faulkner and “A Good Man is Hard to Find,” O’Conner
b. The Haunting of Hill House, Shirley Jackson
c. Interview with the Vampire, Anne Rice
d. The Museum of Dr. Moses: Tales of Mystery and Suspense, Joyce Carol
Oates.
*Please see Literature Circles Rubric for more details on Lit Circles Group Project and
expectations.

3. The final assessment for the unit will be a multi-genre project that has two parts:
a. Part A: Students will be asked to create their own short story, using features of
the Gothic genre, to emulate the style of Edgar Allan Poe. The story should
incorporate at least 5-6 vocabulary words we have learned from the unit, as well
as elements of Gothic fiction such as subterranean passages or crumbling castles.
This project is designed to be a written representation of learning about Poe’s
writing technique, his themes, and creative genius. This is a time to show off
creative flair in the realm of writing. Characters should be fully developed and
plot should have noticeable conflict with rising and falling action, climax, and
resolution. Don’t forget about including the supernatural into the story, as well as
a few of Poe’s themes. (Hint: Think about the ones we’ve studied in class).
Students who choose this option should turn in a rough draft prior to the final
draft, which is due at the end of the unit. I will set up individual conferences to

The Grotesque of the Gothic

Phillips 10

meet with students who select this option after rough draft has been turned in.
Short story should be no more than 4 pages typed, double spaced, 12 pt, Times
New Roman.
b. Part B: Students will create a short audio soundtrack that corresponds with their
short story (above). The soundtrack project is designed to be an artistic
representation of their learning, although a visual may accompany the project.
The idea is to think in terms of thematic connections. The CD need only contain
2-3 songs. A short written explanation in the form of a defense should also
accompany the CD, explaining and defending why each song was chosen, how it
represents the story and your overall learning throughout the unit. Written work
should be no more than 1-1/2 pages typed, double spaced, 12 pt, Times New
Roman, with MLA heading. This project will be due at the end of the unit. Time
will be allotted in class to prepare for and work on projects.
*Do not hesitate to ask if you have questions regarding the CD soundtrack or the short story.
*Please see Rubrics for further details and expectations.

With any group project, the meeker students are likely to lean on those who tend to be stronger,
more dominating. Therefore, literature circles is a great way for each student to grow in his/her
role, learn leadership within that role, learn how to function as a team, and contribute to a unified
vision—the presentation project. On the day students present, each group member will be asked
to fill out the following rubric for each of the other group members within his/her group. After I
have graded presentations, I will weight my grade 75% and weight the student grade the other
25%.

Introductory Activity:
The Grotesque of the Gothic: From Poe to the Present

Activity #1: Chalk Talk
1. A chalk talk is a strategy that helps students explore what they know, or think they know,
about a given subject or topic. As students enter the room, the words “Gothic” and Goth”
will already be written on the board. Once the bell rings, I will briefly introduce the unit
and instruct students to approach the board, 2-3 at a time, to comment on the words by
either directly commenting on one of the words above, or commenting on what another
student has written. This allows for a kind of silent conversation to be started where
students may share their ideas, opinions and questions about the topic at hand.
(10-15 min.)
2. After everyone has had a chance to write something on the board, I will choose a few
quotes from the board as examples and we will discuss as a class what has been written
and how students came to gain that knowledge. I will probably ask the class something
along the lines of “Based on your knowledge reflected here (the board), if I said we were
going to study Gothic Literature, what would that mean to you?” Here I will begin
transitioning to the historical background of how the Gothic came to be. (7-10 min.)
Activity #2: Image analysis
1. I will show a series of images related to Gothic architecture, elements typical of Gothic
fiction, poster images for film adaptations of Poe’s short stories, and lastly images that in
some way depict horror or some type of fright. (10-12 min.)

The Grotesque of the Gothic

Phillips 17

2. Students will be asked to study and describe the images. Are they scary or are they calm
and mellow? What sort of feelings do they evoke? What elements of the image support
your description? They will write their answers before discussing as a class. (5-8 min.)
3. After a brief discussion on what makes a film scary, students will be asked to think about
what movies they have watched that they found frightening. Was it listed in the “horror”
section? What about “horror” films is appealing? What made the movie scary? What
feelings, other than fear, did the movie provoke? “Jot down a couple titles and discuss
this with a partner for five minutes. After you’ve collected your thoughts, use the last ten
minutes to journal in your reading log about these questions. Journal entries should be at
least ½ a page. If time permits, we will discuss thoughts and opinions as a class.”

Week One:
Day 1: Intro to Unit: Monday
 5 minutes attendance, housekeeping, brief intro
 20 minutes—Chalk Talk
o As students enter the room, the word “Goth” will already be written on the board.
Once the bell rings, I will briefly introduce the unit and instruct students to approach
the board, 2-3 at a time, to comment on the word by either directly commenting on
the word above, or commenting on what another student has written. This allows for

genre came to be.
 10 minutes—Brief history of Gothic genre
o Using transparencies, I will show a series of images related to Gothic architecture,
elements typical of Gothic fiction
 20 minutes—Image Analysis & Discussion
o Images include promo posters for film adaptations of Poe’s short stories and images
that in some way depict horror or some type of fright.
o Students will be asked to study and describe the images. Are they scary or are they
calm and mellow? What sort of feelings do they evoke? What elements of the image
support your description? How do you think still images compare to films/movies?
Which has the potential to be more frightening? They will write their answers before
discussing as a class.
o After a brief discussion on what makes a film scary, students will be asked to think
about what movies they have watched that they found frightening. Was it listed in
the “horror” section? What about “horror” films is appealing? What made the movie
scary? What feelings, other than fear, did the movie provoke? “Jot down a couple

Reading Logs and Journals
For this unit, you will be asked to keep a reading log where you record your thoughts and questions
you have about the reading. Occasionally, I may ask you to write about a specific topic and give you
time in class to do so. The purpose of this is two-fold: writing is a way for you to think about what
you are learning AND it helps me learn more about who you are and how you are learning.
Reading logs are due every other Friday. In order to get credit for your entries, you must support
what you are writing by referencing in-class discussions, the reading, homework, etc. You must show
that are paying attention and doing some quality thinking when it comes to what we are reading in
the classroom. Also, how does what we read have bearing on our daily lives? Show me some effort
in making connections to your life today. How does what we read in class connect to your lit circle
book? Use this sheet as a guide for your reading log so you are able to make a good grade and
include quality responses in your entries.
In order to receive full credit, the following must be accomplished:
 Entries must be at least ¾ to 1 full page hand-written or ½ page typed
 Must be legible!
 Turned in on time
 Contain a minimum of 3 entries per week
 Make connections between Poe and Lit circle book
 Address class discussions, readings and/or future desired discussions
 Contain quality, open-ended questions that reflect creative thinking on the part of the reader

Below is a list of journal prompts that I have asked you to respond to throughout this unit. You are
responsible to respond to 4 out of 5 in order to receive full credit.
1. Haunted houses….Do you believe/not believe? Why? Have you ever been in one? Write
whatever you’d like, pertaining to haunted houses.
2. Think about a time when you or someone you know lost a loved one through death or
desertion. The loved one does not necessarily have to be a person; it could be a pet. In your
notebook, write about the experience of coping with grief. Do you think it’s possible for
someone to lose his/her sanity due to intense grief and emotional pain?
3. Imagine that your city or town has been struck by an epidemic of an incurable, fatal disease.
The disease spreads so rapidly but has not reached your particular block. How do you think
you and your neighbors would react? What do you think would be the right thing to do? Jot
down a few ideas in your notebook and then share them with the class.
4. George Bernard Shaw once said, “Tennyson, who was nothing if not a virtuoso, never
produced a success that will bear reading after Poe’s failures. Poe constantly and inevitably
produced magic where his greatest contemporaries produced only beauty.” What do you
suppose Shaw meant by Poe’s “magic?” How might this “magic” be different from “only
beauty?”

Phillips 38

5. Consider the 1994 Film Philadelphia, starring Tom Hanks. Compare the way the characters in
Poe’s story react to the Red Death with the way people today react to the epidemic of AIDS.
How would you react if you knew the person sitting next to you in class each day had AIDS?
What if you were assigned to share a locker with someone had contracted HIV? Would you
try to switch lockers? Would you ask to have your seat assignment changed? What if you
learned that your favorite teacher had the disease? Would this change your opinion of
him/her even if it wasn’t his/her fault?

Discussion Questions, Part 1 for "The Fall of the House of Usher"
You may work with ONE other person to answer these questions.
Time limit: 15 minutes.
All answers must be written on a separate sheet of paper. Due at the end of class.
1) How is the House of Usher described, inside and outside? Which words or phrases are
repeated or which seem important? List them here.
2) How is Roderick Usher described? Which words or phrases describe both Roderick and his
house or his room? List them here.
3) Note where the word "lofty" appears. What does that word mean? To what or whom does it
refer in the story?
4) What are some of Roderick Usher's hobbies? What are some of his beliefs? What are some of
his problems?
5) Describe the narrator of the story. What are his characteristics?
6) How is Madeline described? What do we know about her physical characteristics? Based on
the events that occur in the story, what can we infer about her?

Discussion Questions, Part 2 “The Fall of the House of Usher”
Answer these on your own on a separate sheet of paper and then share
your answers with a partner. Time limit: 10 minutes
1) How is the poem "The Haunted Palace" related to the rest of the story? Which words, phrases,
descriptions, or actions in the poem seem to reflect on characters or events in "The Fall of the
House of Usher"?
2) How is the tale ("Trist") that the narrator is reading near the end of the story related to the
action of "The Fall of the House of Usher"?
3) What happens at the end of the story? Why? What are we supposed to believe? Could these
events take place only in a fantasy world? Are they at all plausible?
4) Poe is interested in the concept of duality: that is, the split between the body and mind/spirit.
How is that idea brought out in the story?

Literature Circles Info
One of the projects you will be participating in this semester is Literature Circles. For those of you
who have never participated in Literature Circles before, they are small groups usually made up of
4-5 people who read the same book. Each person in the group also is assigned a different role, as
listed below:






Discussion Director—comes up with ideas and questions from the reading
Investigator—digs up background information about the book and/or its author
Connector—finds connections between the book and the world and/or its readers
Literary Luminary—selects significant passages for discussion
Illustrator—represents the reading in a drawing or other art form

Each week on Tuesdays and Thursdays, class time will be devoted to this project. Group members
must be prepared and must allocate time for all group members to speak, so plan time wisely.
Additionally, each week you will need to fill out the appropriate sheet for whatever you are fulfilling.
Keep in mind that though the sheets may not be graded, I will be checking to ensure they are
completed each week.
You will select one of four texts for Literature Circles. Groups will be assigned randomly based on
your top 2 book choices. Below are the descriptions for your four choices. Read the descriptions
over. I will also present the books in class to give you a better idea of what the text is about and then
you will sign up for your top 2 picks.
1. A Rose for Emily (Faulkner) & A Good Man is Hard to Find (Flannery O’Conner)
"A Rose for Emily" recounts the story of an eccentric spinster, Emily Grierson. An unnamed narrator details the
strange circumstances of Emily’s life and her odd relationships with her father, who controlled and manipulated
her, and her lover, the Yankee road worker Homer Barron. When Homer Barron threatens to leave her, she is
seen buying arsenic, which the townspeople believe she will use to commit suicide. After this, Homer Barron is
not heard from again, and is assumed to have returned north. Though she does not commit suicide, the
townspeople of Jefferson continue to gossip about her and her eccentricities, citing her family's history of mental
illness. She is heard from less and less, and rarely ever leaves her home. Unbeknownst to the townspeople until
her death, hidden in her upstairs room is the corpse of Homer Barron, which explains the horrid stench that
emitted from Miss Emily's house 40 years ago. (wikipedia.com)
Flannery O'Connor's short story "A Good Man Is Hard to Find" first appeared in the author's short story collection
by the same name, which was published in 1955. Since then, it has become one of O'Connor's most highly
regarded works of short fiction because it exhibits all the characteristics for which she is best known: a contrast
of violent action with humorously and carefully drawn characters and a philosophy that underscores her devout
Roman Catholic faith. Critics have admired the prose and the way O'Connor infuses the story with her Catholic
belief about the role God's grace plays in the lives of ordinary people. The story is disturbing and humorous at
the same time—a quality shared by many of O'Connor's other works, including her novels Wise Blood and The
Violent Bear It Away.
Though the story begins innocently enough, O'Connor introduces the character of the Misfit, an escaped
murderer who kills the entire family at the end of the story. Through this character, O'Connor explores the

The Grotesque of the Gothic

Phillips 44
Christian concept of "grace"—that a divine pardon from God is available simply for the asking. In the story, it is
the Grandmother—a petty, cantankerous, and overbearing individual—who attains grace at the moment of her
death, when she reaches out to the Misfit and recognizes him as one of her own children. For O'Connor, God's
grace is a force outside the character, something undeserved, an insight or moment of epiphany. Often,
however, O'Connor's characters miss moments of opportunity to make some connection; their spiritual blindness
keeps them from seeing truth. (enotes.com)
2. The Haunting of Hill House
Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House has unnerved readers since its original publication in 1959. A tale
of subtle, psychological terror, it has earned its place as one of the significant haunted house stories of the ages.
Eleanor Vance has always been a loner--shy, vulnerable, and bitterly resentful of the 11 years she lost while
nursing her dying mother. "She had spent so long alone, with no one to love, that it was difficult for her to talk,
even casually, to another person without self-consciousness and an awkward inability to find words." Eleanor
has always sensed that one day something big would happen, and one day it does. She receives an unusual
invitation from Dr. John Montague, a man fascinated by "supernatural manifestations." He organizes a ghost
watch, inviting people who have been touched by otherworldly events. A paranormal incident from Eleanor's
childhood qualifies her to be a part of Montague's bizarre study--along with headstrong Theodora, his assistant,
and Luke, a well-to-do aristocrat. They meet at Hill House--a notorious estate in New England.
Hill House is a foreboding structure of towers, buttresses, Gothic spires, gargoyles, strange angles, and rooms
within rooms--a place "without kindness, never meant to be lived in...."
Although Eleanor's initial reaction is to flee, the house has a mesmerizing effect, and she begins to feel a
strange kind of bliss that entices her to stay. Eleanor is a magnet for the supernatural--she hears deathly wails,
feels terrible chills, and sees ghostly apparitions. Once again she feels isolated and alone--neither Theo nor
Luke attract so much eerie company. But the physical horror of Hill House is always subtle; more disturbing is
the emotional torment Eleanor endures. Intense, literary, and harrowing, The Haunting of Hill House belongs in
the same dark league as Henry James's classic ghost story, The Turn of the Screw. (amazon.com)
3. Interview with the Vampire
In the now-classic novel Interview with the Vampire, Anne Rice refreshed the archetypal vampire myth for a late20th-century audience. The story is ostensibly a simple one: having suffered a tremendous personal loss, an
18th-century Louisiana plantation owner named Louis Pointe du Lac descends into an alcoholic stupor. At his
emotional nadir, he is confronted by Lestat, a charismatic and powerful vampire who chooses Louis to be his
fledgling. The two prey on innocents, give their "dark gift" to a young girl, and seek out others of their kind
(notably the ancient vampire Armand) in Paris. But a summary of this story bypasses the central attractions of
the novel. First and foremost, the method Rice chose to tell her tale--with Louis' first-person confession to a
skeptical boy--transformed the vampire from a hideous predator into a highly sympathetic, seductive, and all-toohuman figure. Second, by entering the experience of an immortal character, one raised with a deep Catholic
faith, Rice was able to explore profound philosophical concerns--the nature of evil, the reality of death, and the
limits of human perception--in ways not possible from the perspective of a more finite narrator. (amazon.com)
4. The Museum of Dr. Moses: Tales of Mystery and Suspense
Starred Review. The words gothic and macabre rather than mystery and suspense might better describe the 10
beautifully told stories in this superb collection from the prolific Oates (The Female of the Species). In the
startling opening tale, Hi! Howya Doin!, an overly friendly jogger encounters someone with a less rosy outlook on
life. In the horrifying Valentine, July Heat Wave, an estranged wife finds a very unpleasant surprise in the home
she once shared with her academic husband. In the haunting Feral, a near-death experience transforms a muchloved only child into something wild and unknowable. The title story concerns a horrific exhibit in the home of an

aging coroner in upstate New York (whose behavior is even more troubling). The book's best story, The Man
Who Fought Roland LaStarza, about an aging boxer in a bout that will make or end his career, happens to be
the least gruesome. Powerful narratives, a singular imagination and exquisite prose make this a collection to
relish. (Aug.) (amazon.com)

Literary Analysis: Figurative Language
Understanding figurative language can help you identify a writer’s use of symbols. Types of figurative
speech include similes, metaphors, and personification. Similes and metaphors set up comparisons
between unlike objects and concepts; a simile uses the word like or as to make the comparison, while a
metaphor makes the comparison directly. Personification occurs when a writer gives human traits to
nonhuman things.
Directions: For each passage in the following chart, identify the type of figurative language used. Then
describe the idea, feeling or state of mind that its use conveys to you. What associations and impressions
are formed in your mind by the language? Then answer the question that follows.

Passage

Gothic Unit Assessment: A Multi-Genre Project
1. Short Story: You will create your own short story, using features of the Gothic genre, to emulate
the style of Edgar Allan Poe.
a. Your story should incorporate at least 5-6 vocabulary words we have learned from the
unit, as well as elements of Gothic fiction such as subterranean passages or crumbling
castles. This project is designed to be a written representation of learning about Poe’s
writing technique, his themes, and creative genius. This is a time to show off creative
flair in the realm of writing.
b. Characters should be fully developed and plot should have noticeable conflict with rising
and falling action, climax, and resolution. Don’t forget about including the supernatural
into the story, as well as a few of Poe’s themes. (Hint: Think about the ones we’ve
studied in class).
c. You must turn in a rough draft prior to the final draft, which is due at the end of the unit.
I will set up individual conferences to meet with you after your rough draft has been
turned in to discuss questions or problem areas.
d. Your short story should be no more than 4 pages typed, double spaced, 12 pt, Times New
Roman.
2. Mini-Soundtrack: You will create a short audio soundtrack that corresponds with your short
story (above). The soundtrack project is designed to be an artistic representation of your learning,
although a visual may accompany the project. The idea is to think in terms of thematic
connections.
a. The CD need only contain 2-3 songs. Use your soundtrack from “House of Usher” as a
model.

The Grotesque of the Gothic

Phillips 55
b. A short written explanation in the form of a defense should also accompany the CD,
explaining and defending why each song was chosen, how it represents the story and
your overall learning throughout the unit.
c. Written work should be no more than 1-1/2 pages typed, double spaced, 12 pt, Times
New Roman, with MLA heading.
d. This project will be due at the end of the unit. Time will be allotted in class to prepare for
and work on projects.
*Do not hesitate to ask if you have questions regarding the CD soundtrack or the short story.
*Please see Rubrics for further details and expectations.

<p> Common themes in Southern Gothic literature include deeply flawed, disturbing or eccentric characters who may be involved in hoodoo,[1] decayed or derelict settings,[2] grotesque situations, and other sinister events relating to or stemming from poverty, alienation, crime, or violence. </p>
<p> Elements of a Gothic treatment of the South were first apparent during the ante- and post-bellum 19th century in the grotesques of Henry Clay Lewis and in the de-idealized representations of Mark Twain.[3] The genre was consolidated, however, only in the 20th century, when dark romanticism, Southern humor, and the new literary naturalism merged in a new and powerful form of social critique.[3] The thematic material was largely a reflection of the culture existing in the South following the collapse of the Confederacy as a consequence of the Civil War, which left a vacuum in its cultural and religious values. The resulting poverty and lingering bitterness over the issue of slavery in the region during Reconstruction exacerbated the racism, excessive violence, and religious extremism endemic to the region. </p>
<p> The term "Southern Gothic" was originally pejorative and dismissive. Ellen Glasgow used the term in this way when she referred to the writings of Erskine Caldwell and William Faulkner. She included the authors in what she called the "Southern Gothic School" in 1935, stating that their work was filled with "aimless violence" and "fantastic nightmares." It was so negatively viewed at first that Eudora Welty said, "They better not call me that!"[4] </p>
<p> The Southern Gothic style employs macabre, ironic events to examine the values of the American South.[5] Thus unlike its parent genre, it uses the Gothic tools not solely for the sake of suspense, but to explore social issues and reveal the cultural character of the American South – Gothic elements often taking place in a magic realist context rather than a strictly fantastical one.[6] </p>
<p> Warped rural communities replaced the sinister plantations of an earlier age; and in the works of leading figures such as William Faulkner, Carson McCullers and Flannery O'Connor, the representation of the South blossomed into an absurdist critique of modernity as a whole.[3] </p>
<p> There are many characteristics in Southern Gothic Literature that relate back to its parent genre of American Gothic and even to European Gothic. However, the setting of these works is distinctly Southern. Some of these characteristics are exploring madness, decay and despair, continuing pressures of the past upon the present, particularly with the lost ideals of a dispossessed Southern aristocracy and continued racial hostilities.[4] </p>
<p> Southern Gothic particularly focuses on the South's history of slavery, racism, fear of the outside world, violence, a "fixation with the grotesque, and a tension between realistic and supernatural elements".[4] </p>
<p> Similar to the elements of the Gothic castle, Southern Gothic gives us the decay of the plantation in the post-Civil War South.[4] </p>
<p> Southern Gothic literature set out to expose the myth of old antebellum South, and its narrative of an idyllic past hidden by social, familial, and racial denials and suppressions.[7] </p>
<p> Some have included Eudora Welty in the category, but apparently she disagreed: "They better not call me that!", she abruptly told Alice Walker in an interview.[10] </p>
<p> A number of films and television programs are also described as being part of the Southern Gothic genre. Some prominent examples are: </p>
<p> Southern Gothic (also known as Gothic Americana, or Dark Country) is a genre of acoustic-based alternative rock and Americana music that combines elements of traditional country, folk, blues, and gospel, often with dark lyrical subject matter. The genre shares thematic connections with the Southern Gothic genre of literature, and indeed the parameters of what makes something Gothic Americana appears to have more in common with literary genres than traditional musical ones. Songs often examine poverty, criminal behavior, religious imagery, death, ghosts, family, lost love, alcohol, murder, the devil and betrayal.[23] </p>
<p> The images of Great Depression photographer Walker Evans are frequently seen to evoke the visual depiction of the Southern Gothic; Evans claimed: "I can understand why Southerners are haunted by their own landscape".[34] </p>
<p> William Gibson took an ironic look at the cult of "Southernness" in his novel Virtual Light. Rydell, the stolid, southern antihero, is looking for a job at an LA shop called Nightmare Folk Art—Southern Gothic. The (northern) owner says he finds Rydell unsuitable: "What we offer people here is a certain vision, Mr. Rydell. A certain darkness as well. A Gothic quality....The Mind of the South. A fever dream of sensuality".[35] </p>
<p> Put out by finding himself not southern enough for this New Englander, "'Lady,' Rydell said carefully, 'I think you're crazier than a sack full of assholes.' Her eyebrows shot up. 'There,' she said. 'There what?' 'Color, Mr. Rydell. Fire. The brooding verbal polychromes of an almost unthinkably advanced decay.'"[35] </p>

<p> Coming up next: Introduction to Victorian Literature: Overview of Themes, Style, and Authors </p>
<p> Katie has a Master's degree in English and has taught college level classes for ten years. </p>
<p> In this lesson, we will begin with the definition of Southern Gothic literature. We will then discuss the history of the genre, its characteristics and some of the key authors. </p>
<p> What is Southern Gothic Literature? </p>
<p> Southern Gothic literature is a genre of Southern writing. The stories often focus on grotesque themes. While it may include supernatural elements, it mainly focuses on damaged, even delusional, characters. </p>
<p> Southern Gothic literature was inspired by early Gothic writing, a genre that was popular in 18th-century England. In Gothic literature, the authors wanted to expose the problems they saw in society. The authors wrote fiction, but included supernatural and romantic elements. They were often stories of hauntings, death, darkness and madness. Some of the more well-known examples of this genre are Frankenstein and Dracula. </p>
<p> While Gothic writing initially began in England, American Gothic literature began in the 19th century, with short stories by Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe. Nathaniel Hawthorne also writes with a sense of mystery, and his characters are very flawed. There are some supernatural elements to his writings and many questions about the society that they represent. Poe's short stories usually focus on death, but he tells the tale of death with a dark humor and a desire to expose the complexity of his characters and society. </p>
<p> Writers, such as William Faulkner, began writing a more specifically Southern form of American Gothic in the 1920s. However, the Southern Gothic genre reached its height in popularity in the 1940s-1960s. </p>
<p> Characteristics of the Genre </p>
<p> Although inspired by Gothic literature, Southern Gothic does not dwell on suspense and the supernatural. Rather, there is a dark humor in the stories. It follows the idea of exposing the problems of society, but does so by developing complex characters. The authors explored the behaviors of people (usually strange) and the social order of the South. Through their stories, the authors hoped to show that the social order was fragile, and the realities behind it were actually disturbing. The authors work to point out truths of Southern culture and its moral shortcomings. The themes of this genre are developed around these goals. </p>
<p> The stories of Southern Gothic are, of course, set in the South. They may take place on a plantation, old slave quarters or broken-down towns. There are many Southern elements in the stories, including dialect, habits and personalities. The history of the South is represented through the settings of the stories. </p>
<p> The characters are usually complex, and many of them are mentally unstable. Many of the characters are broken in spirit and struggling to find a place in society once again. The morality of characters is often questioned. Through their characters, the authors examine the harm that people can do to each other. There are also many characters that are seen as innocent, such as the mentally handicapped, and there is a struggle for their place in the world. Whether mentally unstable, dark or innocent, the characters try to make sense of the world around them and the society in which they live. </p>
<p> The plots of Southern Gothic stories can be disturbing and some do include supernatural elements. They often contain ironic events as a writing style. Many of the events contained in the stories are linked to racism, violence and poverty. </p>
<p> Southern Gothic Authors </p>
<p> In the 1920s, William Faulkner began writing Southern Gothic literature. His novels are set in Mississippi and often take place in older Southern towns and plantations. They contain many Southern archetypes, or examples or patterns, including roles in Southern society. The characters often are suffering and show this through Faulkner's stream of consciousness, where an author writes the characters thoughts as they would flow through one's mind. In addition, the stories are often grotesque and involve death and loneliness. For example, in his short story 'A Rose for Emily,' it is discovered that the lonely old woman who recently died had the corpse of an old lover in her bedroom. </p>

<p> One of the most well-known writers of the genre is Flannery O'Connor. Her stories expose many contradictions of Southern society and contain many grotesque actions and characters. They are morally flawed and the hints of racism in the South linger throughout. Many of her characters appear to be normal at first, but as the stories develop, the audience begins to see the flaws and how these flaws represent many problems of the South in the 1930s. While the stories may contain some supernatural elements (especially suggestions of God and faith), the circumstances are always believable. </p>
<p> For example, in her short story 'A Good Man is Hard to Find,' a family traveling is convinced by their grandmother to take a different route to visit an old home. Once they start down the road, the grandmother realizes that they are going the wrong way, but she is afraid to tell them. The car eventually lands in a ditch and the family is stranded. Although they are initially relieved when help comes, they realize that it is 'the Misfit,' an escaped convict who has stopped. He murders the family. The story is dark, yet also ironic. The Misfit was from a good family, but still a murderer. The grandmother, the archetype of the Southern lady, leads her family directly to the Misfit. </p>
<p> The genre's popularity grew in the 1940s, not just with O'Connor, but Harper Lee, Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams and Carson McCullers. Southern Gothic literature is still written today. Some of the more recent authors of this genre include Cormac McCarthy and Kami Garcia. </p>
<p> Lesson Summary </p>
<p> Southern Gothic literature is a genre of Southern writing that focuses on the grotesque. It may contain some supernatural elements, but often more realistic flawed characters and settings. The genre was inspired by Gothic writing, which began in the 19th century with Edgar Allan Poe and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Some of the major characteristics of Southern Gothic literature are dark humor, complex characters that expose flaws in society, Southern elements (like plantations, old downtowns and dialect) and questions of innocence and God. The plots are often disturbing with ironic events and death. In the 1920s, William Faulkner revived Southern Gothic literature, and it grew in popularity throughout the next several decades with Flannery O'Connor, Harper Lee, Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams and Carson McCullers. The genre is still popular today. </p>

<p> An Exploration of Southern Gothic Literature </p>
<p> The Foundations of Gothic Literature </p>
<p> Gothic literature is believed to be created by Horace Warpole, an 18th century English author who wrote The Castle of Otranto. In his 1764 novel, Warpole used a mixture of horror and romance to ultimately create the atmosphere of the gothic genre. Gothic writing is full of intense feeling; it "embodies an appreciation of the joys of extreme emotion, the thrills of fearfulness and the awe inherent in the sublime" ("Gothic Fiction"). The plots of most gothic novels depend on unnerving, supernatural, unusual and/or ironic events ("Southern"). The grotesque is very common in gothic literature - in form of character flaws, disturbing settings and violent plot events. Through displaying grotesque concepts and images, gothic writers are able to make nasty and usually avoided aspects of culture apparent; when the sub-genre of southern gothic literature was created from gothic literature, these issues tended to focus on racism, poverty, violence, moral corruption and ambiguity ("Southern"). The southern gothic genre did not arise until the mid-1900s, when issues with racism and segregation in the U.S. were still in tremendous disagreement. The genre reached its height of popularity between the 1940s and the 1960s, when writers made a point to reference all the negatives and weaknesses in the current state of southern American society and culture ("Southern"). Born from gothic literature, southern gothic took all the creepy and terror-inducing aspects of the gothic genre and infused them with the struggles of the south to create a whole new type of literature. </p>

<p> Dying is an art. </p>
<p> The Abject, the Grotesque and the Uncanny; an excerpt </p>
<p> “This was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me.” — The character of Jonathan Harker from Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel Dracula. </p>
<p> Any analysis of the term ‘gothic’ will inevitably conjure its related terminologies: the ‘abject’, the ‘grotesque’, and the ‘uncanny’. By its very nature, the Gothic contains elements of each of these terms, although it maintains a separate and very distinct character. All three of these terms find a varying degree of expression within my Disobedient Dollhouse. The first term ‘the abject’ was coined by the psychoanalyst Julia Kristeva in her seminal essay entitled Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection. Abjection is primarily concerned with societal taboos surrounding the materiality of the body, and the horror that arises from exposure to bodily excretions such as blood, pus and feces. For example, the horror associated with blood is a central theme to Bram Stoker’s Dracula, the classic Victorian Gothic novel in which the legend of the vampire is powerfully invoked. In Powers of Horror, Kristeva classifies the corpse as representing the utmost in abjection: “[The corpse] is death infecting life. […] Imaginary uncanniness and real threat, it beckons to us and ends up engulfing us.” When confronted with a corpse, we are forced to address our own mortality and the inevitable corruption of our own bodies. </p>
<p> Fig. #5 - Lithograph from "The Disobedient Dollhouse", Jennifer Linton, mixed media installation, 2009-10. </p>
<p> The abject is clearly present within my Disobedient Dollhouse. A group of dead mice hang by their tails inside a kitchen cabinet, presumably providing a food source for the other inhabitants of the Dollhouse. A sinister bird-headed woman stands before the cabinet, clutching the tiny, skeletal remains of a rodent-like creature (fig. #5) While this scene does not contain any signs of blood or viscera, these small rodent corpses offer the presence of violent death, thus contributing to an atmosphere of abject horror within this Victorian-style dollhouse kitchen. Although animal and not human, these tiny corpses nevertheless serve as potent reminders of our own eventual demise. </p>
<p> While elements of abjection are undeniable within my Dollhouse, the second terminology related to the Gothic – the term ‘grotesque’ – has played a significantly greater role in the development of my imagery for this project. The term ‘grotesque’ originated in the ancient Roman period and relates to fanciful, decorative flourishes in art and architecture. Grotesque art involves the fantastic, ugly and bizarre, and its subjects are frequently mythological creatures and other strange, physically malformed monsters. The bizarre, anthropomorphic creatures that populate Lewis Carroll’s children’s novel Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland are a primary example of ‘the grotesque’ in literature. Carroll’s novel has also proved a valuable source of inspiration for the fantastic hybrid creatures that inhabit my Disobedient Dollhouse. In fact, the only human figure that appears in my Dollhouse is a character loosely based on Carroll’s Alice. This character – ostensibly a self-portrait as I served as the model – appears twice, once as the beleaguered ‘nanny’ in the nursery, and again as the ‘cook’ in the kitchen. The ‘nanny’, gazing down with quiet stoicism at the squawking bird-infant cradled in her arms, was based upon a </p>
<p> Fig. #6. John Tenniel. Illustration for Lewis Carroll’s "Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland", 1865, wood engraving. </p>
<p> 19th century illustration for Carroll’s novel by John Tenniel depicting Alice holding a bonneted baby pig (fig. #6). The monstrous brood housed inside my nursery – heads tilted up with beaks wide open, their arms thrust outwards in a gesture of relentless, constant need – represent every parent’s nightmare of unending responsibility. The parental anxiety symbolized by this scene has been tempered, however, by an element of the absurd. Much like the ridiculously grotesque image of the bonneted pig held by Alice, my bird-headed children are designed to elicit equal measures of pathos, humour and horror. My nursery most assuredly conveys parental anxiety, but it does so with tongue firmly planted in cheek. </p>
<p> Grotesque art revels in the absurd, championing a fantasy world of the irrational over the rigid strictures of realism. One tactic employed by Lewis Carroll to create the ‘grotesque’ in Alice was his effective play with scale, a scheme that underscored the absurdity of his Wonderland. Alice experiences a succession of physical transformations when, enticed by the label on a mysterious bottle that reads ‘DRINK ME’, she consumes its contents only to magically shrink in size: </p>
<p> “It was all very well to say ‘Drink me,’ but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. ‘No, I’ll look first,’ she said, ‘and see whether it’s marked “poison” or not’… […] However, this bottle was not marked ‘poison,’ so Alice ventured to taste it, and […] she very soon finished it off. ‘What a curious feeling!’ said Alice; ‘I must be shutting up like a telescope.’ And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.” </p>
<p> After her initial transformation, Alice consumes a cake labeled ‘EAT ME’ and shoots upwards in the opposite direction, growing large so suddenly that she becomes trapped within the house. </p>
<p> As the sudden alteration of a person’s size is impossible without the intervention of magic, this change in scale is both fantastic and absurd in nature. Alice’s transformation from miniature to gigantic in Carroll’s novel provides clear evidence of the absurd, even comical, possibilities of this play with scale. This does not, however, necessarily apply to an object. The miniature furniture contained within a dollhouse, for instance, does not appear absurd or grotesque due to its strict adherence to a standard scale. In fact, the adherence to scale is one of the most fundamental principles of any dollhouse. Any object within this miniature world that deviates from the standard scale appears strangely incongruous in relation to its surroundings. Susan Stewart, in her analysis of the dollhouse, quotes the author Arthur Benson from his introduction to The Book of the Queen’s Dolls’ House: </p>
<p> “The scale of one inch to one foot being precisely maintained throughout…thus there is nothing of the grotesque absurdity of a scene that does not resemble life and has only the interest of caricature.” </p>
<p> The accuracy of scale within a dollhouse creates a sense of realism. Hence, when a deviation from scale occurs, the illusion of reality is severely comprised. Similar to Carroll, I have adopted elements of ‘the grotesque’ in my Disobedient Dollhouse by playing with the scale of objects. In fact, several deviations in scale exist. In the kitchen, in the guise of the household cook, I attempt to wield a gigantic eggbeater that stands as tall as my miniature self (fig. #7). The exaggerated difference in size – plus the fact that, undaunted, I continue to struggle with the giant kitchen utensil – heightens the grotesque absurdity of this scene. </p>
<p> Fig. #7 - Lithograph from "The Disobedient Dollhouse", Jennifer Linton, mixed media installation, 2009-10. </p>
<p> One creature that appears repeatedly throughout my Dollhouse is the insect. Changing the size of the insect, as well as the context in which the insect is received, is a simple gesture that invokes ‘the grotesque’. Initially, I drew these insects to actual scale from specimens found in a local museum. When placed on the walls of my Dollhouse, however, these same insects suddenly appear gigantic in relation to the miniature scale therein. This change of context – from a normal sized insect in our world to a gigantic one in the miniature world – alters the perception of these creatures from ordinary to grotesque. When these same insects are scaled up, appearing as giants that loom over the viewer within the gallery space, this encounter with the grotesque is further intensified. As the contents of the Disobedient Dollhouse emerge into the surrounding exhibition space, the viewer becomes immersed in its fantastic world – no longer a mere observer but a full participant in its alternate reality. </p>
<p> The repetition of the insects and change of their scale harkens back to my earlier analogy of the Russian matryoshka nesting doll – a doll within a doll, each one a slightly smaller version of the larger doll that contains it – an analogy suggestive of an almost endless replication. By playing with scale, I allude to the infinity of repeated space, an infinity that is only truly attainable in my ‘house of dreams.’ </p>
<p> An encounter with giant insects on a gallery wall – insects made strange by the fact of their surprising scale – can be classified as an encounter with ‘the uncanny’, the third and final of the terminologies related to ‘the Gothic.’ Our present day understanding of the term ‘the uncanny’ has been largely shaped by the psychoanalytic viewpoint of Sigmund Freud’s 1919 seminal essay entitled “The Uncanny”. In his essay, Freud defines the uncanny experience as: “that class of the frightening which leads back to something long known to us, once very familiar.” To experience something as ‘foreign, and yet familiar’ may result in feelings of discomfort and alienation. In this regard, the concept of ‘the uncanny’ is closely related to Julia Kristeva’s theory of abjection – in which the human corpse can be simultaneously experienced as alien (the abject) but also felt to be strangely familiar (an individual, now deceased). Freud situated ‘the uncanny’ in the realm of the repressed: “[The uncanny] is in reality nothing new or alien, but something which is familiar and old – established in the mind and become alienated from it only through the process of repression.” According to the Freudian psychoanalytic model, the process of repression involves the rejection and subsequent suppression of troubling impulses and desires. The concept of repression closely relates to the suppressed ‘family secret’ frequently found within the Gothic narrative. Whereas the Gothic ‘family secret’ manifests in the guise of a vengeful ghost, repressed desire assumes the form of the uncanny person or object. </p>
<p> In his essay “The Uncanny,” Freud analyzes the etymology of ‘unheimlich,’ the German word for ‘uncanny.’ His analysis proposes a strong linkage of ‘the uncanny’ to the domestic setting of the home. The German term das Heimlich signifies that which feels homely, comfortable and familiar. The inversion of this term, das Unheimlich, negates this feeling of comfort and suggests an estrangement or feeling ‘not at home,’ literally ‘unhomely.’ Through the process of repression, the safe haven of the home becomes ‘self-haunted’ by ghosts of the unconscious, a phenomenon that transforms the otherwise comfortable and familiar setting into a place that feels inexorably strange. </p>
<p> In his catalogue essay for the exhibition Gothic mounted at the ICA Boston in 1997, curator Christoph Grunenberg reflects on the nature of the uncanny: </p>
<p> “The invasion of the private and secure sphere of the home by some unknown evil force exemplifies the conflict between interior and exterior world, between individual and society, and between the intra- and intersubjective. Ultimately, the uncanny describes the return of repressed events, memories, and fantasies – the encounter with one’s own most intimate fears…” </p>
<p> The “private and secure sphere” of the home becomes the site of internal conflict, where the repressed are stowed away in hidden rooms, behind locked doors, in attics, closets and cupboards. Ultimately resisting suppression, the repressed reemerge as the ‘uncanny’ and transform the home into a strange and frightening place. </p>
<p> The ‘uncanny’ appears throughout my Disobedient Dollhouse in the strange and otherworldly transformations. The bed – that most psychologically potent of symbols – literally boils over with desire and sprouts flowers from the elongated bedposts. Snakes emanate from the tousled bed sheet and slither across the floor, penetrating the wooden floorboards and sinking into the room beneath. These uncanny transformations hint at a secret world of sublimated desire, resistant to the forces of repression that are compelled to hide them away. Like the ‘madwoman in the attic’ of Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre, they periodically escape imprisonment, only to wreck havoc in the realm of the conscious. </p>

<p> THE GOOD, GROTESQUE AND GOTHIC </p>
<p> These are some of the typical elements of Southern Gothic Literature - Please review them and reflect on our story. How does Flannery O'Connor's 'The Life You Save May Be Your Own' relate to these elements? YOU HAVE TEN MINUTES. </p>
<p> 1. Settings most often include large, drafty old houses that have "been in the family for years." Since castles in the American landscape were practically unheard of, early Gothic fiction writers began substituting the family estate for the traditional castle. </p>
<p> 2. An atmosphere of mystery and suspense that is enhanced by a plot which seeks to discover the secrets lying within the supernaturally charged environment. </p>
<p> 3. A ghostly legend, an unexplainable occurrence, or a story about a horrible death or murder that took place at the family estate in question. </p>
<p> 4. Omens, foreshadowing, and dreams usually play a large role in the mysterious air that is created within the story. </p>
<p> 5. Tales include highly charged emotional states like: terror, a feeling that one is on the brink of insanity, anger, agitation, an exaggerated feeling of some impending doom, and obsessive love. </p>
<p> 6. Supernatural events: ghosts, doors that open themselves, unexplained sounds, etc. Okay, so Mockingbird isn’t exactly supernatural, but narrated through the eyes of a terrified six-year old, it might as well be. </p>
<p> 7. Damsels in distress are frequent. Women who are frightened and confused, wandering around lost, or dying due to a slow and unexplainable ailment. </p>
<p> 8. Words designed to evoke images of gloom and doom: dark, foreboding, forbidding, ghostly, etc. </p>
<p> 9. Romantic themes often involve the death of a man or woman in the throes of some great passion, the obsessive nature of a man or woman in love, or excessive grief one feels upon the loss of a loved one. </p>
<p> 10. Injustice. Almost every character in Mockingbird is at least somewhat racist, including our lovable narrator from time to time. 11. The grotesque. Atrocities. Monsters. Torturers. Circus-like curiosities. Characters that fit the mold can run the gamut. Mrs. Dubose is a great example of a grotesque character; she’s a humorless old bigot with an unnecessarily possessive attitude toward her camellias. Southern writer Carson McCullers used grotesque characters to illuminate universal truths about the human condition. She said, “Love, and especially love of a person who is incapable of returning or receiving it, is at the heart of my selection of grotesque figures to write about—people whose physical incapacity is a symbol of their spiritual incapacity to love or receive love— their spiritual isolation.” </p>
<p> 12. One of the defining features of southern gothic is the cast of off-kilter characters, many of whom are "not right in the head." The genre is riddled with many broken bodies, and even more broken souls. When southern gothic authors examine the human condition, they see the potential to do harm. Morality is in question for many characters. A major theme for southern gothic writers hinges on innocence, and the innocent's place in the world—where they are often asked to act as redeemer. </p>

<p> The Life You Save May Be Your Own has a gloomy setting. It takes place in an old farm, that is mostly abandoned but an old women and a down-syndrome girl. Another aspect that is gloomy in the ending, when the boy kills himself in a pit, which was an act of insanity. The story itself is stranger than any other story. It is a lot different than any other story, and is creepy at some points. Another Gothic aspect in the woman in the story. She is in a way disabled, and cannot speak or listen to her own husband. In conclusion, The Life You Save May Be Your Own is a Gothic piece of writing, and is very strange for sure. </p>
<p> The story "The Life You Save Might Be Your Own" uses many of the shown elements in typical southern gothic literature. It takes place mostly in a big, dark looking house, where only two people live. From the start of the story, you are slowly learning more about the characters and plot of the story. It becomes darker and darker, especially because of the way the writer tells the story. The atmosphere of this story is definitely very mysterious. You don't know who Shiftlet is, and in the beginning he seems very dangerous and scary. An image can be made from the story due to the author's choice of words. You can imagine what is happening to these people, what they are doing. The deaf daughter adds a sense of sympathy and also confusion. I can tell the time period adds to the plot of the story and the feelings you might experience throughout reading it. Shiftlet is eerie and grotesque, like how he has one half of one arm and the way he looks. Also, its very weird how after marrying the deaf girl, he leaves her helpless and alone in a diner. None of the characters in this story are normal, which sort of makes it more interesting. All in all, these are some of the gothic elements used in this story. </p>
<p> There are many ways in which Flannery O'Connor's 'The Life You Save May Be Your Own' relate to these elements. One element that stuck out to me was the element where there is an an atmosphere of mystery and suspense that is enhanced by a plot. The part when the man is leaning on the car asking random questions to the lady was very mysterious to me because I had no idea what was going to happen next, and I would have never of guessed that the daughter and the man get married in the end. In this story there are also words designed to evoke images of gloom and doom. When the author started to describe e place that the old lady and the daughter were saying, there were a lot of words that evoked images in my head of a very dark spirited town. These characteristics of the story ‘The Life You Save May Be Your Own’ are what make it a very gothic short story. </p>
<p> Flannery O'Connor's 'The Life You Save May Be Your Own' has several elements inside of it that shows why it is a piece of Gothic literature. The setting is one element. It is an old lady's home that has been falling apart through the generations. Old houses, or 'estates', are always present in Gothic literature. Another element used is the atmosphere of mystery that this story shows. Right from the beginning, the author sets the scene with an eerie, mysterious atmosphere. Added onto the strange atmosphere is the words that are used to create it in the first place. They all seem dark and foreboding which sets the Gothic scene even better. Finally, the characters in the story show how Gothic this is. Mr. Shiftlet is a one-armed man who has had many jobs and has gone to many places. He doesn't seem right in the head, and this is shown through the first conversation the we witnessed by him. It was a very different way top meet somebody for the first time. ~Joshua Tyler </p>
<p> Flannery O’Conner’s story, The Life You Save May Be Your Own, demonstrates many of the characteristics of an American gothic story. First of all, all three of the main characters are somewhat mentally disturbed. Mr. Shiftlet is a conman whose only goal is to take the Lucynell Crater senior’s car, which shows a criminal steak in his nature, old Mrs. Crater’s main goal is to get herself a son in law by sticking Mr. Shiftlet with her disabled daughter, which paints her as a manipulative and tricky old hag, and finally, Lucynell Crater junior is deaf and mute, which not her fault in anyway and does not reflect on her at all, but still shows mental instability nonetheless. A damsel in distress theme is also somewhat evident, as Lucynell junior is completely helpless, and it first appears that Mr. Shiftlet is trying to help her, at least until he dumps her off in a diner. Finally, the charged psyche of Mr. Shiftlet changes frequently, from the senile paranoid mumbling of a beggar, to the sly cunning of a thief, and finally the sheer terror experienced by him when the lone boy in the car exacts his hateful rant on Mr. Shiftlet. By no means is this story ordinary, but it does depict some of the key qualities of an American gothic story. </p>
<p> Flannery O'Connor's 'The Life You Save May Be Your Own' relates to these elements of gothic literature in many ways. For instance the setting is a an old and lonely house somewhere in the south. As well the story contains a damsel in ditress, the hitch hiker who Mr. Shiflet picks up. Also the story contains a few odd characters like the old lady in the story and Mr. Shiftlet. Mr. Shiflet merely appears to be a bit strange and "not right in the head", while the old lady seems slightly grotesque and wier with her possesiveness of her daughter and her lack of teeth. Another relations to the elements of a gothic story include are when mystery behind who is Mr. Shiftlet and why is he there as well as what was his past like. The last element that the story seems to posses is a ghostly legend. This can be seen when the old lady explains the the car stoppped working when her husband died. </p>
<p> There are many examples of gothic literature in The Life You Save May Be Your Own. One would is that there is an atmosphere of mystery and suspense throughout the story. An example of this would be is when the man is randomly asking questions to the lady, this came off a bit mysterious to me. Also, this was suspensful, as I couldn't predict what was going to happen and I was intrigued. The story also has a sort of dark, gloomy setting, which is an old farm. This story is a very creepy, dark story, which adds to its gothic nature. </p>
<p> Flannery O'Connor's, The Life you Save May Be Your Own, is a Gothic piece of writing that uses many elements that are used to help the story better. A few elements are setting, atmosphere, and romantic elements. These elements and some others are used to make the story better in a way because when they are used the right way it could make the story more detailed and easier to comprehend. the setting and the atmosphere are probably the most important things that are needed. The setting is where the story takes place and the atmosphere is almost added effect on the setting. These key elements are very important for this reason. </p>
<p> Flannery O'Connor's, The Life You Save May Be Your Own, is a gothic tale for a number of reasons. One way that the story can be considered gothic is because they are dark feature or gloomy surroundings. I believe that it is actually kind of creepy the way that the author decided to present each character is suspicious and creepy in a way. Supernatural events occurred in this story, which also made the story seem gothic, so to speak. Mr. Shiftlet taught Lucynell Crater, the daughter, how to say certain words even though she is deaf. I personally think it is a supernatural event because usually deaf people can't talk and never learn how to speak. Flannery O’Connor’s, The Life You Save Maybe Your Own, may not seem like a gothic tale, however it definitely had its aspects. </p>
<p> The Life You Save May Be Your Own has a lot of traits in common with gothic literature, which leads me to believe that it is. First, the setting is much like the settings in gothic literature. The Crater's house had been theirs for year and it is very beat down. Next, there is a dark atmosphere where you feel that there is much more being hidden from you. An example of this is when Mr. Shiftlet keeps talking about humans will do anything and that you don't know what someone is like just by looking at them. There was also a tale told by Mr. Shiflet that a doctor cut out a human's heart and held it in his hand, however the doctor will never know what the person was like just by the heart no matter what you do to it. There also is a confused women that we know nothing about, which is the daughter Lucynell Crater. She jumps up and down, claps her hands,makes odd noises for no apparent reasons, and sometimes doesn't even know where she is. One can only assume that she is mentally ill. This adds even more to the dark atmosphere, for the mother Lucynell pushed Mr. Shiftlet to mary her, and the daughter Lucynell may not even know what is going on. Mr. Shiftlet also dierly wanted to live by his own morals and by what his mother taught him, however Mrs. Lucynell Crater forced her to marry her daughter. There are also off-kilter characters, like the boy who gets in Mr. Shiftlet's car. </p>
<p> The Life You Save May Be Your Own relates to many parts of gothic literature. This story posses many gothic words, and puts them in the story to help the reader better understand the situation at times. For example one of the sentences says that "he had a man's gray hat pulled down low over her head." This is put in the story to bring out the creepyness or how the lady is different. Another example would be "He seemed to be a young man but he had a look of composed dissatisfaction as if he understood life thoroughly." These are two examples of how this story posses certain words that help the reader understand the people involved in this story. </p>
<p> Jason Hopkins "The Life You Save May Be Your Own" is a very peculiar story. It has many Gothic elements in it. To start off, when we first see Lucynell Crater, the daughter, she is presented as odd. In the beginning of the story we don't know what is wrong with her. Every character comes into the story in an odd way. Mr. Shiftlet,in particular, creeped me out. I thought the man was going to attack the old lady, not marry her. The tone of the story had no emotion whatsoever. It felt really dark and out of place. You have this disabled kid who the mother says she would never give away, but she also doesn't mind her daughter's disabilities. It was very interesting to see Lucynell react to the environment. When the boy killed himself, it actually scared me and made me think about the situation more. Mr. Shiftlet was a very odd character, in my opinion. The story was very odd but interesting. </p>
<p> In 'The Life You Save Maye Be Your Own", there are many examples of these gothic elements. To being, all three characters, the old women, the daughter and Mr. Shiftlet are all kind of strange, disturbed people. In continuation, the house in which the old lady and her daughter live in is 'beaten down' and there is a lot that can be fixed about it. Also, their car hasn't run in 15 years, since the old womens husband died. Those are examples of the setting element. In addition, the supernatural/the twisted natural is somewhat involved in this story Next, this story did have some sense of a mystery in which you were unsure of how the story was going to play out in the end or how all the characters were going to conect to one another which brings in the second element. Further, the third element, which is about the story being a gostly legend or murder doesn't exactly apply to this story. However, towards the end, when Mr. Shiftlet leavs the daughter just at The Hot Spot which wasn't really any special place. To add on, element nine, which talks about romance is somewhat included in this story since Mr. Shiftlet and the daughter get married even though it wasn't real love since the old women wanted them too. Finally, the last element, number twelve, could be somewhat included in this story because the old women isn't exactly right in the head since she wants a strange man, she just met, to marry her daughter even though she said no one was ever going to take her daughter away from her. Also, the daughter is about thirty years old however that is impossible to tell because of her innocence. It states in the begining that she is a large girl wearing 'a short blue organdy dress' even though she is about thirty years old. All in all, I found this story more wierd and jsut plain strange rather than really dark and gothic. </p>
<p> Flannery O'Connor's 'The Life You Save May Be Your Own demonstrates some strong aspects of Gothic literature. First off, the cast of characters are rather strange. Among these are an old woman who dresses like a man, a guy who talks about hearts being amputated and cut up, and a chubby girl with severe mental ailments. Furthermore, the story has a rather gloomy conclusion with a boy killing himself over growing frustration and insanity. This gives the story a creepy atmosphere and creates a rather sad, strange and gloomy ending. </p>
<p> In Flannery O'Connor's "The Life You Save May Be Your Own", even though it is hard to tell, it is a Gothic story. You can tell it is a Gothic story by looking and interperting the text. One part in the story when the mysterious man was walking up the road, you can tell that it is a Gothic because of the man's mysterious ways. The way Flannery O'Connor describes his features sort of gives an ominous and mysetrious feeling to the story. Another thing is the atmosphere and setting of the story. The atmosphere seems kind of different and the whole concept of the story is all a little too strange. For an example, when the man walks into the yard he just lifted his arms(even though he was missing one of his arms) and just stares out into the sunset. He doesnt reply for a little while when asked a question and I thought that was a little strange. As the story goes on and begins to come to an end O'Connor gives you a little slogan to think about. The slogan is the same name as the title of the story, "The Life You Save May Be Your Own." Mr. Shiflet seems like a nice and caring man who wouldn't do any harm, but as the story progresses you begin to understand that he might have a secret side to him. The part where he left the deaf girl in Hot Spot changed my view of him a lot and you can tell that he is trying to "save himself." These are a few ways you can tell that the story relates to the elements of a Gothic story. </p>
<p> There are a few of these elements that relate to the story, 'the life you save may be your own.' The setting in the story talks about an old house that has a girl and an old lady living in. The author didn't mention if the house was owned by their previous generations of family, but it did say that it was am strange, old house. Second,there was an atmosphere of mystery and suspense in the story. Mr. Shiflet seemed very mysterious throughout the entire story. Also, there were many different tyoes of emotion in this stoey. For example, Mr. Shiflet didn't seem to want to marry the old lady's daughter, but in the end he did. All the characters changed emotion throught the story. You could also say that the old lady's daughter was a damsel in destress, because she seemed to be confused in the story, and didn't ever talk. Injustice could also have taken place in the story. I didn't understand the story so much, but Mr. Shiftlet let the old lady's daughter alone in a resturant. This seems very unfair, because I don't think she knows how to talk, and she probably doesn't know where she is. This story contains many of the elements that are listed here, and they relate very well. </p>
<p> Flannery O'Connor has not really dark elements in her short story "The Life you Save May be your Own" it's mostly supernatural elements and aspects to it. She demonstrates supernatural through out the whole story. An example the way Flannery describes the environment and how the characters look and act. For example on page 2 paragraph 21 she described the moon and how it appeared in the branches of the fig tree. This would be supernatural because even in movies and other stories there would be a scene of the full moon at night behind an old tree. Another supernatural element that I notice was the way Flannery describe the weather and how the clouds were gray and in odd shapes like a turnip. The weather on the last page quoted "After a few minutes there was a guffawing peal of thunder from behind and fantastic raindrops". The story even had mystery because for one you wanted to know why Lucynell was acting weird when she spotted Mr.Shiftlet. That scene was a mystery because as the reader you want to know everything you can about the character until later you dicover that Lucynell is deaf. Also Flannery made Lucynell a damsel in distress because Lucynell was deaf and in a way helpless because she could not hear or speak to anyone. </p>
<p> There are several instances in which Flannery O'Connor's 'The Life You Save May Be Your Own' relates to the elements of a gothic story. For example, when Mr. Shifflet is first introduced the setting of the story is strange. The old lady lives in an old house with just her daughter. The langueage used my the author gives the reader the idea of a creepy broken down house. Additionally, the woman is a widow. This brings up the element of death. This can make a reader feel the woman is helpless. She has no husband and a daughter who is deaf. Also, the daughters state of mental health is also adding to the story. Her first incounter of Mr. Shifflet was fright. Futhermore, Tom's arrival was unexpected. That instantly brings his character into question. Mr. Shifflet himself said "How do you know I am not lying?" The old woman and her daughter have no clue what this mans intentions are. This creates an atomosphere of fear and anxiety. Lastly, when Tom is driving away and ne see the sign that says " The life you save may be your own." The sign holds significence to the action that just accorded in the story. Tom just saved himself from a life of misery and frustration. </p>
<p> In "The Life You Save May Be Your Own" three of the key components make this story Gothic Literature. For example, 7 and 10, because Lucynell being the damsel in distress and the kid Mr. Shiftlet picks up after he ditches Lucynell in a cafe, and the injustice in the end of the story when the Mr. Shiftlet marries Lucynell to get the car and some money. The one part of the story that is left mysterious is who Mr. Shiftlet actually is, and what he is after. Obviously, at the end of the story, we find out he's after the car. </p>
<p> Flannery O'Connor's "The Life You Save May Be Your Own" relates to most of these elements. It relates to element one due to the fact that it takes place at an old family estate. It also relates to element two, five and seven. When the story begins the setting or atmosphere is gloomy. When Mr. Shiftlet comes to the old woman's house the sky is different than its usual form and the family seems cross. Near the end of the story the boy and Mr. Shiftlet have an argument about the boy leaving his mother. There is much tension and the boy ends up getting kicked out of the car. Lynell seems to be like the dansell in distress. She wanders around not quite knowing what is going on because she is deaf. The narrative applies to element nine too. Lynell and Mr. Shiftlet become fond each other and end up getting married. </p>
<p> There are a few ways that Flannery O'Connor's 'The Life You Save May Be Your Own' relate to the elements. First, the setting is at an old house near the mountains in the middle of nowhere. It is definitely drafty because it is old and has a lot of areas that need to be fixed. This story also has an atmosphere of mystery and suspense. This is because a one-armed stranger shows up at the house of an old woman and a mentally ill girl. You are wondering why he is there and what exactly wrong with the girl. You are also curious as to why the old woman is a widow. Where is her husband? I think it is also strange how Mr. Shifflet said how he could be lying about his identity. Of course he was right, there was a big possibility he was lying. But there was no way for the old woman to make sure he was who he said he was. I think this almost foreshadows that there is something odd about him. The daughter is almost like a grotesque character. She seems to be mentally ill, but you don't know the details. She doesn't speak much and acts like a small child. Innocence is definitely a theme in this story. The daughter is innocent, simply because she is "not right in the head." She hasn't hurt anyone, but the one-armed stranger leaves her alone after getting married. This shows that his morality is in question.

<p> Discovering Literature: Romantics & Victorians </p>
<p> The Gothic </p>
<p> Professor John Bowen discusses key motifs in Gothic novels, including the uncanny, the sublime and the supernatural. Filmed at Strawberry Hill House, Twickenham. </p>
<p> Here we are in Horace Walpole's house, Strawberry Hill. This is the place where both the Gothic revival in architecture and Gothic fiction began. The whole thing is a fake or theatrical version in miniature of what a Gothic or medieval castle might be. But it's not just architecturally that this house is important, because it's also very important in literary terms. </p>
<p> One night when he's asleep in his bedroom upstairs and dreams of a gigantic armoured fist appearing on the staircase behind me – and that inspires him to write The Castle of Otranto. This is published in 1764 and begins this enormously powerful tradition that continues to the present day in hundreds of books, television programmes and films. </p>
<p> Gothic fiction is fascinated by strange places. On the one hand very wild and remote landscapes and on the other, to very imprisoning places. So, if you think of the end of Frankenstein, there on the wild, arctic wastes. Well the other one is somewhere like Dracula, where you get imprisonment of poor Jonathan Harker, whose a nice, modern young man – goes off to Central Europe and he's suddenly captured by Count Dracula and imprisoned in this violently, archaic world. So, it's a sudden transformation, both in the space that he's living in and the place that he goes to. It's also, of course, a change in the kind of time that Dracula's living in. He moves from a modern world – this is a world of typewriters, of recording equipment, of stenography, of modern trains – suddenly to a world that reaches back into most archaic and distant sense of time. And that's very typical of all Gothic fiction. It wants to see the relationship between the modern world and the past – not as one of evolution or development – but of sudden juxtaposition and often violent conflict, in which the past erupts within the present and deranges it and one of the most powerful motifs of that is, of course, the ghost. The thing that you think is dead but comes back vividly alive in the present. </p>
<p> So, at the heart of Gothic fiction is the question of power. On the one hand it tends to be drawn to very powerful, often supernaturally powerful, or obscenely powerful figures and on the other, to people who are completely vulnerable. He seems to want to do this to explore the limits of what it is to be human – to be driven by either internal desires or forces outside yourself that make you or compel you to do things you don't want to do. And that, of course, gives it an enormous scope to explore the positions, say of women, in 19th-century society or 18th-century society – the way that women often are forced into situations in which they are confronted by irrational kinds of desire or need to which they are vulnerable and which may make their very life at risk. </p>
<p> Gothic novels are full of perverse, weird and dangerous kinds of sexuality. It's often fascinated by incest, by same sex desire, by violence, by abduction, by rape. So, Gothic is a kind of writing that can make explicit, what is often held back within more normal kinds of writing. On the one hand, it's fascinated by total sexual power, by these obscene patriarchal figures, who seem to be able to have no restraints whatsoever on their desire. It's also constantly drawn to the figure of the vulnerable young woman and her possible triumph over these apparently, unbeatable forces. </p>
<p> One really useful term for thinking about Gothic writing, is the uncanny. Now this is a term that comes from Sigmund Freud – so something that's new but that also takes us back to something, either in our own psychological past, or something in the world that's archaic. Often Gothic fictions drive onwards to these uncanny moments for the reader, in which you suddenly recognise somebody who seems unfamiliar and strange – in fact, has an identity that you already know. So, figures that are not quite human, that look human but are not entirely human, like dolls, wax works, automata – these are very characteristic marks – not just of Gothic but particularly of the uncanny. </p>
<p> In the mid 18th century, critics and writers became more and more fascinated by experiences that don't seem to fit within their normal category of what's beautiful and what's pleasurable. They get fascinated by – what's it mean to be in the middle of a storm at sea, or to see a shipwreck, or to be on the top of a high mountain in a great wind. And the work that they use more and more to describe this is – the sublime. The sublime isn't harmonious, balanced and beautiful – which had traditionally been the concern of the aesthetic but is often terrifying and awesome and overwhelming and Gothic is absolutely at the centre of that move to the sublime and sublimity in understanding the world. </p>
<p> Gothic particularly tends to appear at moments of political and social crisis, so there's an enormous increase in the number of Gothic novels written in the 1790s. There's another burst at the end of the 19th century, so at moments of great political change, particularly following the French Revolution in 1789, the Gothic seems a way of trying to master and understand these enormous changes. That's a religious crisis too. The Catholic Church is despoiled, its abbeys and its monasteries are closed and that feeds into the Gothic sense of doubt about the supernatural. </p>
<p> Gothic is fascinated by the supernatural. In Matthew Lewis's famous novel, The Monk, Satan himself appears at the end of the book and the main character, Ambrosio, sells his soul to the devil. But, there's also a very different kind of writing, like that of Ann Radcliffe, who's the other great Gothic novelist of the 1790s, where there is no supernatural. There do appear to be ghosts but, in fact, by the end of the novel all those ghosts have been explained in a naturalistic way. So, there are two different kinds of Gothic – one that uses the supernatural, as it were, and expects us to believe in it – and the other that gives a natural or realistic explanation of it. </p>

<p> The grotesque in gothic is usually the behavior of a man (or women,) who battle with an internal conflict and they are also, usually sick. When an individual reads gothic stories, one can sometimes miss-interpret what they have read. It is common knowledge that when we are younger we understand things differently from when we grot be adults. We can infer that if one was too read gothic literature as a child, one would find it humorous, versus if that individual was to read gothic literature as an adult. As an adult you might not find the text humorous, but rather disturbing.

<p> There are thousands of gothic literatures that follow this theme. To come to terms with the extent of how gothic writers impacted psychology, one should know the history behind psychology. The first American psychology laboratory was opened in 1883; the first American gothic novel titled "Wieland," was published in 1798, eighty-five years before the laboratory opened. Somnambulism was discovered in the early 1900s; somnambulism is the fact or habit of walking about and performing other actions while asleep; sleep-walking. ("Somnambulism, n." OED Online, Oxford University Press, June 2017, www.oed.com/view/Entry/184510. Accessed 16 November 2017.) A man by the name of, Sigmund Freud spoke about sleepwalking to the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society in 1907; Charles Brown published his short story "Somnambulism. A fragment" in 1805, one hundred and two years before Sigmund Freud formally addressed the mental illness. In 1887 the mental illness, schizophrenia was discovered by, Dr. Emilie Kraepelin; however, the mental illness was not named until 1911 by Swiss psychiatrist, Eugen Blueler. Edgard Allen Poe published his short story "A Tell-Tale Heart" in 1843; "A Tell-Tale Heart" was narrated by a schizophrenic man. A key person in the gothic genre is Edgard Allen Poe.

<p> Discovering Literature: Romantics & Victorians </p>
<p> The origins of the Gothic </p>
<p> Professor John Mullan examines the origins of the Gothic, explaining how the genre became one of the most popular of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and the subsequent integration of Gothic elements into mainstream Victorian fiction. </p>
<p> Gothic fiction began as a sophisticated joke. Horace Walpole first applied the word ‘Gothic’ to a novel in the subtitle – ‘A Gothic Story’ – of The Castle of Otranto, published in 1764. When he used the word it meant something like ‘barbarous’, as well as ‘deriving from the Middle Ages’. Walpole pretended that the story itself was an antique relic, providing a preface in which a translator claims to have discovered the tale, published in Italian in 1529, ‘in the library of an ancient catholic family in the north of England’. The story itself, ‘founded on truth’, was written three or four centuries earlier still (Preface). Some readers were duly deceived by this fiction and aggrieved when it was revealed to be a modern ‘fake’. </p>
<p> The novel itself tells a supernatural tale in which Manfred, the gloomy Prince of Otranto, develops an irresistible passion for the beautiful young woman who was to have married his son and heir. The novel opens memorably with this son being crushed to death by the huge helmet from a statue of a previous Prince of Otranto, and throughout the novel the very fabric of the castle comes to supernatural life until villainy is defeated. Walpole, who made his own house at Strawberry Hill into a mock-Gothic building, had discovered a fictional territory that has been exploited ever since. Gothic involves the supernatural (or the promise of the supernatural), it often involves the discovery of mysterious elements of antiquity, and it usually takes its protagonists into strange or frightening old buildings. </p>

<p> The Mysteries of Udolpho </p>
<p> In the 1790s, novelists rediscovered what Walpole had imagined. The doyenne of Gothic novelists was Ann Radcliffe, and her most famous novel, The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794) took its title from the name of a fictional Italian castle where much of the action is set. Like Walpole, she created a brooding aristocratic villain, Montoni, to threaten her resourceful virgin heroine Emily with an unspeakable fate. All of Radcliffe’s novels are set in foreign lands, often with lengthy descriptions of sublime scenery. Udolpho is set amongst the dark and looming Apennine Mountains – Radcliffe derived her settings from travel books. On the title page of most of her novels was the description that was far more common than the word ‘gothic’: her usual subtitle was ‘A Romance’. Other Gothic novelists of the period used the same word for their tales, advertising their supernatural thrills. A publishing company, Minerva Press, grew up simply to provide an eager public with this new kind of fiction. </p>
<p> The Mysteries of Udolpho </p>
<p> The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794) by Ann Radcliffe was one of the most popular and influential Gothic novels of the late 18th century. </p>
<p> Northanger Abbey </p>
<p> Radcliffe’s fiction was the natural target for Jane Austen’s satire in Northanger Abbey. The book’s novel-loving heroine, Catherine Morland, imposes on reality the Gothic plots with which she is familiar. In fact, Radcliffe’s mysteries all turn out to have natural, if complicated, explanations. Some critics, like Coleridge, complained about her timidity in this respect. Yet she had made a discovery: ‘gothic’ truly came alive in the thoughts and anxieties of her characters. Gothic has always been more about fear of the supernatural than the supernatural itself. Other Gothic novelists were less circumspect than Radliffe. Matthew Lewis’s The Monk (1796), was an experiment in how outrageous a Gothic novelist can be. After a parade of ghosts, demons and sexually inflamed monks, it has a final guest appearance by Satan himself. </p>

<p> Frankenstein and the double </p>
<p> A second wave of Gothic novels in the second and third decades of the 19th century established new conventions. Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818) gave a scientific form to the supernatural formula. Charles Maturin’s Melmoth the Wanderer (1820) featured a Byronic anti-hero who had sold his soul for a prolonged life. And James Hogg’s elaborately titled The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner (1824) is the story of a man pursued by his own double. A character’s sense of encountering a double of him- or herself, also essential to Frankenstein, was established as a powerful new Gothic motif. Doubles crop up throughout Gothic fiction, the most famous example being the late 19th-century Gothic novella, Robert Louis Stevenson’s Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. </p>
<p> This motif is one of the reasons why Sigmund Freud’s concept of the uncanny (or unheimlich, as it is in German) is often applied to Gothic fiction. In his 1919 paper on ‘The Uncanny’ Freud drew his examples from the Gothic tales of E T A Hoffmann in order to account for the special feeling of disquiet – the sense of the uncanny – that they aroused. He argued that the making strange of what should be familiar is essential to this, and that it is disturbing and fascinating because it recalls us to our original infantile separation from or origin in the womb. </p>
<p> Images </p>
<p> Extreme psychological states and horror </p>
<p> Another writer who commonly exploited doubles in his Gothic tales was the American Edgar Allan Poe. He used many of the standard properties of Gothic (medieval settings, castles and ancient houses, aristocratic corruption) but turned these into an exploration of extreme psychological states. He was attracted to the genre because he was fascinated by fear. In his hands Gothic was becoming ‘horror’, a term properly applied to the most famous late-Victorian example of Gothic, Bram Stoker’s Dracula. The opening section of Dracula uses some familiar Gothic properties: the castle whose chambers contain the mystery that the protagonist must solve; the sublime scenery that emphasises his isolation. Stoker learned from the vampire stories that had appeared earlier in the 19th century (notably Carmilla (1872) by Sheridan Le Fanu, who was his friend and collaborator) and exploited the narrative methods of Wilkie Collins’s ‘sensation fiction’. Dracula is written in the form of journal entries and letters by various characters, caught up in the horror of events. The fear and uncertainty on which Gothic had always relied is enacted in the narration. </p>

<p> The Gothic in mainstream Victorian fiction </p>
<p> Meanwhile Gothic had become so influential that we can detect its elements in much mainstream Victorian fiction. Both Emily and Charlotte Brontë included intimations of the supernatural within narratives that were otherwise attentive to the realities of time, place and material constraint. In the opening episode of Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights, the narrator, Lockwood, has to stay the night at Heathcliff’s house because of heavy snow. He finds Cathy’s diary, written as a child, and nods off while reading it. There follows a powerfully narrated nightmare in which an icy hand reaches to him through the window and the voice of Catherine Linton calls to be let in. The vision seems to prefigure what he will later discover about the history of Cathy and Heathcliff. Half in jest, Lockwood tells Heathcliff that Wuthering Heights is haunted; the novel, centred as it is on a house, seems to exploit in a new way the Gothic idea that entering an old building means entering the stories of those who have lived in it before. </p>
<p> Illustrations to Wuthering Heights by Barnett Freedman </p>
<p> Illustration of Lockwood’s nightmare vision where Cathy reaches through the window. By Barnett Freedman, estimated 1940. </p>
<p> Two of Charlotte Brontë’s novels, Jane Eyre and Villette, feature old buildings that appear to be haunted. As in the Gothic fiction of Ann Radliffe, the apparition seen by Jane Eyre in Thornfield Hall, where she is a governess, and the ghostly nun glimpsed by Lucy Snowe in the attic of the old Pensionnat where she teaches, have rational explanations. But Charlotte Brontë likes to raise the fears of her protagonists as to the presence of the supernatural, as if they were latterday Gothic heroines. Gothic still provides the vocabulary of apprehensiveness. Similarly, Wilkie Collins may have introduced into fiction, as Henry James said, ‘those most mysterious of mysteries, the mysteries which are at our own doors’, but he liked his reminders of traditional Gothic plots. In The Woman in White, all events turn out to be humanly contrived, yet the sudden appearance to the night-time walker of the figure of ‘a solitary Woman, dressed from head to foot in white garments’ haunts the reader as it does the narrator, Walter Hartright (ch. 4). The Moonstone is a detective story with a scientific explanation, but we never forget the legend that surrounds the diamond of the title, and the curse on those who steal it – a curse that seems to come true. The final triumph of Gothic is to become, as in these examples, a vital thread within novels that otherwise take pains to convince us of what is probable and rational. </p>

<p> The Sublime’s Effects in Gothic Fiction </p>
<p> With ghosts, spacious castles, and fainting heroes, Gothic fiction conveys both thrill and intrigue. Gothic literature is a combination of horror fiction and Romantic thought; Romantic thought encompasses awe toward nature. Essentially, Romanticism is a reaction against the Enlightenment, a time that revolutionized scientific thought, and emphasizes emotional response and intuition over clinical knowledge. Romantic literature elicits personal pleasure from natural beauty, and Gothic fiction takes this aesthetic reaction and subverts it by creating delight and confusion from terror. This use of terror is called the sublime, which is an important tool in these narratives. Examples of Gothic literature range from dark romances to supernatural mysteries. </p>
<p> In Gothic novels, no matter the setting or villain, the sublime exists as a different experience than appreciating natural beauty. In fact, this concept deals with how authors capture their characters’ trauma and fear. It is important to look at the sublime in the lens of both the characters’ experiences and the real world contexts that influence them. </p>
<p> Beyond identifying the sublime, a crucial part of looking at this technique is seeing how the fears present in Gothic literature factor into real life concerns, such as the enforced roles and restrictions faced by women. The use of terror illuminates how the marginalized, once given a voice, cope with their harrowing predicaments, and reading about these struggles helps foster comprehension and empathy. </p>
<p> Defining the Sublime </p>
<p> What separates experiencing the sublime from experiencing beauty is the disruption of harmony. As stated above, it shows elements of Romantic reactions to human experience while utilizing fear as well. According to Edmund Burke, the imagination experiences both thrill and fear through what is “dark, uncertain, and confused.” 1 In setting the sublime apart from beauty, the sublime creates more than a positive, appreciative response to an aesthetic, such as a beautiful painting or sunlit meadow. The sublime stems from potent awe and terror that stresses someone’s limits, surpassing all other responses and overloading the recipient in both their revulsion and fascination. </p>
<p> In regards to the Romantic view of the environment, the sublime can occur when natural grandeur overwhelms an individual to the point of causing fright or a feeling of helpless insignificance. Overall, approaching the sublime occurs when a sight or experience is “awesome” or ” awful” in the old meaning of both words: characterized by or inspiring awe, and awe is an emotion containing fear, wonder, and reverence. The sublime questions the stark dichotomy between pleasure and pain because a fear-invoking scene can also cause wonder, an odd sort of delight. In a contemporary sense, it could be viewed as watching a train wreck: horrifying, but captivating to the viewer. </p>
<p> Because of its potency and Burke’s gendered views, he viewed the Romantic or Gothic sublime as a more masculine and powerful experience than beauty, which he perceived as feminine, and therefore more fragile and superficial. However, Mary Wollstonecraft, an English writer and avid women’s rights advocate, argued against this perspective and its depiction of women as inherently weak and passive. For Wollstonecraft, the sublime dealt with the self and its subjective views of society and spectacular natural scenery. </p>
<p> Interestingly enough, Ann Radcliffe, the English writer who pioneered the Gothic novel (as well as the “Female Gothic” novel, Gothic literature for women, by women), maintained that horror and terror exist as separate entities, and that terror, not horror, creates the sublime because, while horror is definite, terror provokes ambiguous emotions, which in turn “expands the soul and awakens the faculties to a high degree of life.” 2 Horror involves witnessing the monster, of seeing blood or a corpse, while terror burrows into an individual’s unclear psyche and entails multiple, conflicting emotions stirring at once. </p>
<p> Gender and Evoking the Sublime </p>
<p> Going off of Mary Wollstonecraft’s view of the sublime as a part of her relationship to society (and how 19th century Western culture treated women’s intelligence and education), the sublime, through overwrought sensory details, can reveal what scares the character based on real struggles. For women in Victorian England (1837-1901), the sublime is triggered through a fear of confinement and suppression based on societal expectations; an example of this fear appears in Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre 3. </p>
<p> In the beginning, Jane experiences terror when her aunt locks her inside the red-room, the former chambers of her dead uncle. As her imprisonment lingers, the experience takes its toll on Jane, and she soon believes her uncle’s ghost, a patriarchal symbol, will rise and attack her. She states, “My heart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated; endurance broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort” (11). </p>
<p> Jane Eyre becomes enraptured in an experience that affects her on both a physical and emotional level, an experience that strains her, that challenges her and extends past the capacity of her imagination. The sublime creates hysteria, and the concept of “hysteria” derives from the archaic belief that cis women act in excess or have uncontrollable, irrational bouts of emotions when their uterus does not function properly. Considering the Victorian woman’s experience, as well as earlier ones (though published in the Victorian era, Bronte set the novel in the Georgian era) the red-room may be red for a variety of symbolic reasons: menstruation (Jane is ten at the novel’s beginning and will soon enter puberty); passion; torment; blood. </p>
<p> Furthermore, Jane’s imprisonment in the red-room stems from punishment for confronting her male cousin after he hits her and insults her because she is dependent on his family and because the books she reads are not her own. She suffers for rebelling, for educating herself and living in an environment where she does not possess her own independence, so the surreality of her break with reality emphasizes the terror of her experience as a girl approaching womanhood. </p>
<p> In Jane Eyre, this issue also manifests in the character of Bertha Mason, the wife of Jane’s love interest, who spends several years locked in an attic because of her mental instability. Because of society’s treatment of mental illness, especially in regards to Bertha’s gender and racial identity, Bertha becomes as trapped as Jane was at the start of the novel, and her ordeal culminates in a result that is both terrifying to witness but dazzling and gripping in its own terrible way: fire. </p>
<p> Frankenstein: Awe-Inspiring Feats and Standards of Beauty </p>
<p> 5 The Sublime in Gothic fiction </p>
<p> Mary Shelley’s novel Frankenstein 4 deals with many complex themes while invoking the sublime. She considered the novel her own monster, with herself as the creator. While many of her male contemporaries mainly worked with poetry and operated in exclusive chats, Mary Shelley wrote a complex novel at a young age. </p>
<p> The narrative deals with the impact of nature. In fact, Frankenstein challenges the aspect of nature itself as the titular character, Victor Frankenstein, researches both modern science and alchemy to defeat death. In terms of the environment, the Monster comes to life due to a violent storm. Before that, Victor speaks of feeling jubilation from a startling and intriguing natural event. </p>
<p> When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight. As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed. </p>
<p> This scene not only shows the sublime, but foreshadows Victor’s ruination. Victor’s own accomplishment is an awe-inspiring feat; it is an action that incites inspiration and terror as the Monster becomes a strikingly intelligent living being, but suffers marginalization because he is the embodiment of the sublime and not beauty. The Monster is painful to look at, and therefore mistreated and accosted. </p>
<p> Victor becomes the modern Prometheus, the Titan who brought fire to humanity at a terrible cost. By mirroring the Titan’s fate, Victor performs a grand feat, fueled by knowledge and breaking boundaries, and suffers not only for his transgression, but for neglecting his grotesque creation, his child, for a superficial reason. </p>
<p> Though he initially seeks for his creation to be beautiful, the actual result elicits terror. Victor states, “No mortal could support the horror of that countenance.” When the living creature moves, it then “became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceive.” The situation, as miraculous and groundbreaking as it is, becomes Victor’s own personal hell. As his life unravels, the reader becomes the recipient of a sublime experience: as horrific as the downfall is to witness, the narrative propels the reader forward to the bleak and devastating conclusion. </p>
<p> One could also determine that this Gothic tragedy also displays elements of dissecting the fears of Victorian cis women, though the Monster’s creation and how people treat him have also become representations of brilliant but morally-questioned modern innovations (genetically modified food; cloning animals) and contemporary marginalization (issues of race, sexuality, transgender identity, disability, etc.). </p>
<p> Concerning the fears of Victorian cis women, Mary Shelley’s mother, the aforementioned Mary Wollstonecraft, died from a post-birth infection, and Shelley herself suffered from miscarriages and the deaths of infant children and dreamed of one of her babies returning to life. It is entirely possible that Frankenstein contains Shelley’s thoughts on both the wonder and trauma of childbirth, since Mary’s own birth caused her mother’s infection and death. </p>
<p> In the preface for Frankenstein, Mary Shelley writes, “And now, once again, I bid my hideous progeny go forth and prosper. I have an affection for it, for it was the offspring of happy days, when death and grief were but words, which found no true echo in my heart.” The Monster and his creation are not only representations of the sublime, but the novel itself, for it exists as both an entity of woe and happiness concerning the author’s past, present, and future misfortunes. </p>
<p> As an important part of Gothic works, the sublime helps readers uncover aspects of humanity. The commingling delight and terror deal with personal emotions and experiences for both the characters and the works’ authors, as well as the audience. It is essential to not only be able to define and find the sublime in Gothic literature, but to also determine the causes of fear in hopes that the reader can empathize with the complex, overwhelming struggles presented in various works. Though this is a 19th century concept, the pivotal issues presented in Gothic works such as Jane Eyre and Frankenstein reverberate in modern culture. </p>

<p> Thanks for the comment! When looking at Jane Eyre from the perspective of both gender and race (the treatment of Bertha Mason), things definitely get complicated. Still, the nuanced treatment of gender merits much thought, especially in regards to the societal confinement Jane faces–both as a woman fighting for agency and as someone not conventionally beautiful when the common thought then was beauty=good (a theme explored in other works such as The Picture of Dorian Gray). </p>
<p> Thank you for the comment. The sublime is a wonderful tool for composing Gothic works. </p>
<p> Thanks for the response. I agree. In fact, the ambiguity and surreal elements are likely why Gothic works are my favorite horror subgenre–alongside Weird fiction. </p>
<p> My favourite reading of Frankenstein is that, through Victor’s mentions of ‘penetrating’ nature, the novel implies that the monster is the victim and vengeful result of Nature being raped by science. Such a fun read. </p>
<p> Frankenstein is one of my favorite novels, if not my favorite, because of the several different readings that can be taken from it. Mary Shelley infused so much complexity and nuance into a single work. </p>
<p> Because of the thematic significance of the perils of taking science too far and childbirth/Biblical creation, I think there’s something to the reading you’ve stated. It reminds me of a song by one of my favorite bands that essentially compares mankind conquering a feminized nature to rape–and the consequences of that sustained violation. It helps that the earth and its fertility normally take on a female personification, especially in pagan religions (Ishtar; Demeter) where cisgender women are associated with conception. </p>
<p> I’ve seen the same language in Tagore’s The Home and the World, and likely many other works–where the defilement and “conquest” of Mother Nature becomes a rape allusion. It fits with the Gothic issue of gender and attempting to “tame” an individual or relegate women to recipients, as well as the terror and confusion that ensue from the trauma, from the struggle to assert power against debilitating odds. It reminds me of how the Myth of Persephone changed, and now the myths of her as the sole queen of the dead are much less known than the story of her being kidnapped and tricked to be Hades’ wife. </p>
<p> Excellent work! This is a really interesting piece and I find Frankenstein to be one of my favorite classics. I have been thinking about trying a gothic fiction work or something and this article has definitely helped inspire me to do so! </p>
<p> Thank you! As someone currently working on a Southern Gothic retelling of The Fall of the House of Usher and another Gothic story, I fully encourage writing in this genre. I’m extremely glad to hear this article could act as inspiration. Best of luck on whatever you come up with! </p>
<p> Thank you! And much luck to you as well in your writing projects! I look forward to reading them! ^_^ </p>
<p> I find it interesting that a definition that you give for sublime came from a figure of the Enlightenment. The only point of concern that I have is that you may have read too much into current conceptions of gender to make your argument. </p>
<p> It is interesting, especially in terms of how the topics of science and nature play on one another and the relationship between the Enlightenment and Romanticism–with one being a reaction to the other. </p>
<p> Also, I hear you on the retrospective (or rear-view) lens of gender appearing here–seeing past works through contemporary standards. The great thing about literature, especially Frankenstein, is how many different readings can occur for one piece, as well as seeing how certain issues presented in a text may or may not persist. I guess it’s the same way works like The Merchant of Venice change in perception when a character like Shylock is viewed in a contemporary time versus how he would have been regarded then. For some, it calls into question the timelessness of certain works, while it can also make the discussion more relevant. </p>
<p> Going away from gender, Frankenstein invokes this a lot where it’s used as shorthand for issues like animal cloning and genetic modification. I also recall a book that mentioned Frankenstein to simultaneously discuss feminism and vegetarianism/the animal rights movement. In fact, Frankenstein is everywhere to the point that it’s difficult to ignore. </p>
<p> Anyway, I started rambling, as I’m wont to do with Mary Shelley. Thanks for the comment! </p>
<p> Anyone who thinks Jane Eyre the character is some little submissive, repressed weakling compared to her far more “progressive” sophisticated “liberated” successors found in the most dreadful of all genres “chick lit” doesn’t know crap. </p>
<p> I’m a very proud feminist from the 70s/80s generation and I thoroughly despise, loathe and detest chick lit. </p>
<p> Give me Jane Eyre any day — a novel that examines a young woman with no status and with absolutely no one in the world to help and protect her, who survives a horrific school yet manages to get a decent education out of it, bravely goes out into the world totally on her own with no protection or patronage with zero connections, uses her education to make a living, takes an unloved child into her heart and transforms a man lost in his own self pity. A woman who demands to be treated as an equal in a time when such things were subversive. </p>
<p> Jane Eyre the woman is a far more courageous, intelligent, thoughtful character than any of the idiots populating the incredibly mindnumbing scribblings found in “chick lit.” </p>
<p> Gothic horror may be old but it’s so popular it’s being re-invented all the time, because it speaks to the human story and the human heart. </p>
<p> I enjoyed this article. Gothic fiction tells us the truth about our divided nature. </p>
<p> Frankenstein is a fantastically conflicted character. In many ways the Creature is an externalisation of Victor Frankenstein’s own frustration at the suffocating effect of his domestic relations. His duties to his family and friends hold him back and prevent him from acheiving his dreams. The Creature acts like a destructive avatar, and sets about murdering Victor’s family and friends. Yet Victor’s motivation in creating the Creature are his yearnings to be invincible – he wishes to create a race of creatures immune to death and nature. </p>
<p> For the Creature’s part, it desires to receive the domestic affection that Victor flees from, and which Victor denies it. Realising it cannot have this itself, it determines to destroy Victor’s loved ones in revenge. </p>
<p> I really enjoyed your explanation of the sublime. You wrote a lot about gender, and that highlighted for me the parallels between Gothic/Romatic and Masculinity/Femininity. </p>
<p> What a wonderful job you’ve done defining and in the texts you gloss capturing the sublime and its importance. I have always felt that the sublime is just such an experience—whether encountered through literature or life experience elsewhere—that shakes us to our core, terrifies us, and, like the steep cliff down which we now look, understanding our selves as mere trifles of the universe, which at any moment may blow us to dust and leave us forgotten, also allows us, because of our new awareness of our smallness, to be more alive than we have ever been, if momentarily. I feel that you have captured that very well, particularly in Frankenstein. </p>
<p> jane eyre for me exploded the myth of patriarchal strength with revelations of the hypocrisy of the dominant species – the lying, greed, deceit and weakness. </p>
<p> I always thought that horror and gothic were different things in fiction. Horror being written specifically to thrill while gothic literature less immediately thrills but gives one a deep sense of fear, a sort of unsettling feeling that at the root of all things there is a darkness. So gothic would certaintly be Wuthering Heights for example, where as outright sci-fi type thriller type of novel, say IT by Stephen King would be straight horror. Dracula as another example would sort of bridge the two genres. </p>
<p> Exactly — horror and the gothic might overlap in places in treatment, but they are not identical. </p>
<p> There’s also what was known in its time of tremendous popularity, with stories with that attitude and approach printed even in daily newspapers, sensational literature, or Yellowbacks, when released on pulp paper and yellow paper cover. This too would often bridge gothic and horror. </p>
<p> In case anyone has the idea that Frankenstein is great work of literature, forget it. The concept was brilliant, the marketing unerring. The execution was badly written scurrilous trash. </p>
<p> “A perfect example of the grotesquely sublime is her heavenly vision while standing in the hog-pen.” -Lauren Gibson </p>
<p> I think the connection to fear vs. horror is right on point. Today we throw the word “sublime” around without realizing that it’s original meaning speaks to something so much deeper and more profound then simple interest. </p>
<p> This brings me back to studying the Gothic as part of my BA degree, I loved The Monk! Fascinating attitudes to Catholicism in novels of that time. </p>
<p> This is such a wonderful, well-written article! I thoroughly enjoyed how you correlated the sublime to women’s rights, and your references to Female Gothic. All your points are every deep; it really made me reconsider Gothic lit in a new light. Your thoughts concerning Jane Eyre and Frankenstein were also intriguing, I’m going to have to read the books with new insight now. Again, wonderful work! </p>
<p> Wonderfully written article! I personally love gothic art, romanticism, and the enlightenment. Great meditation on the progression of a movement of art! </p>
<p> Dang, wish I’d seen this article when I was writing my midterm/final for my Gothic literature course… </p>
<p> It’s really interesting to me that the sublime is a key characteristic of science fiction as well – and that gothic fiction works as a foreground for science fiction in many ways, notably through Mary Shelley. I tend to think of Shelley as a primary science fiction novelist precisely because Frankenstein is so concerned with the sublime and rationality and how those two intertwine. That grasping for rationality amidst the terror of the sublime is a very gothic experience, though – something I believe has survived to today’s literature primarily through science fiction. (Although horror definitely has some aspects as well.) Very interesting article! </p>
<p> *Sighs* I really enjoyed this. I loved reading about your examples, I love the accompanying images you chose, and, I would love for you to write more on this subject. </p>
<p> What are you favorite examples of Gothic literature? </p>
<p> A beautiful piece, very well documented! I like all the links you make and the way you use visuals (images and informative video) to ground your arguments. Make the reading very easy! </p>
<p> For those who enjoy reading Byron, and is fascinated by the idea of Byronic Hero, try Lermontov’s “Hero of Our Times”, or Pushkin’s “Eugene Onegin”. These works represent the golden age of Russian Romanticism. </p>
<p> It’s interesting to try and identify the sublime in contemporary gothic (or in contemporary fiction that utilises gothic paraphernalia), especially with respect to representations of nature. In many dystopian or eco-fiction today, it appears that nature is still terrifying. But what I find lacking is the sense of awe that the early gothic writers constructed in depictions of the natural world. I wonder if this is because of the way the media constructs the natural world as something dangerous and unpredictable and thus society sees the natural world as an “other” that we must be wary of… </p>
<p> This is inspiring me to look deeper into Gothic literature as a genre. I have read Frankenstein, Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre and enjoyed each of them in turn. It seems that there is a strong connection between primal behaviors, madness and nature. Which is consistent with Foucault’s history of mental illness and the changing social perception of “madness” over time. As the scientific method became more accepted, the mentally ill went from being innocent (and “touched by God”) to dangerous criminals. Once nature was viewed as an adversary to be conquered by science, the mentally ill were made into sinners who were akin to “the beast”; the natural representation of Satan. And they were forthwith punished accordingly. I see dramatic parallels in these stories between the unstable force of nature and the devious behaviors of the characters who are closest to the natural world – Heathcliff as a gypsy, Kathy as she felt drawn to the heathen Heathcliff and whose wandering of the moor spelled her demise, Bertha Mason and the insanity that was portrayed as being lustful and primal, and the monster (Frankenstein) who had poor impulse control (a hallmark of mental illness). Great article! </p>
<p> Thank you so much for putting this into words! I work in a library, and we’re putting together a display with the theme of ‘the sublime’ in literature. This article has helped us better determine what exactly we need for the display, and how to define ‘the sublime’ in general. So I just wanted to say a quick thank you, and to note this was very well-written and thought through! </p>
<p> This was awesome. I loved the research and thought in this article. I loved Jane Eyre in high school and it remains one of my favourite classics. It is true that the gothic works have something special in them. Wonderful insight ! </p>
<p> Came across this while researching for a literature requirement. I was reading Fullmetal Alchemist against Frankenstein, and I found it interesting how both works show the glory of mankind’s achievements AND the possible destructive potential of these same accomplishments. You put a name to what I was thinking about: the sublime. Thank you! This has been very insightful. 🙂 </p>
<p> A bit tangential, but isn’t it kind of interesting that Brian Aldiss once conceived of SF as the natural inheritor of the gothic, saying in Brilliant Year Spree that science-fiction was ‘the search for a definition of man and his status in the universe which will stand in our advanced but confused state of knowledge (science) and is characteristically cast in the Gothic or post-Gothic mode.’ Sublime spec fic! </p>
<p> I’ve been wondering about how exactly the “sublime” works as both and neither a positive and a negative experience. This article summed it up, while talking about some of my favourite people and books. Thanks a bunch for writing this 🙂 </p>
<p> Good thorough explanation of the sublime in Gothic works, so glad I found this article for my final paper/project on the Gothic. Helped me a lot when deciphering my other scholarly sources.Thanks </p>

<p> Types of Gothic Fiction </p>
<p> The word "Gothic" brings to mind everything from architecture to vampire novels to </p>
<p> depressed teenagers. But the original "Goths" were barbaric Germanic tribes from 376 to 410 C.E. who caused the destruction of Roman culture. People started referring to anything savage or medieval as "Gothic" until the term became synonymous with anything extravagantly horrifying or irrational. The beginning of the Gothic literary movement was in part a reaction to the rationalist thinking of the Enlightenment. </p>
<p> Gothic Romantic Novels </p>
<p> Gothic fiction began with the Gothic novel. Horace Walpole and William Beckford introduced a new genre of literature with "The Castle of Otranto: A Gothic Story" (1765) and "Vathek" (1786) respectively, a style which later writers, such as Matthew Lewis and Anne Radcliffe, would imitate and perfect. Gothic novels take place in medieval settings and isolated locales, such as Italian castles or monasteries. Chaste, fainting heroines, corrupt, scheming monks and chivalric, knightly heroes drive the plots. Because many of these Gothic novelists published during the era of Romanticism, a literary movement also characterized by excess, sensibility and imagination, Gothic writers during this period are also considered Romantic. </p>
<p> Victorian Horror </p>
<p> Romanticism's legacy of not only Anne Radcliffe but Mary Shelley and the Bronte sisters saw the domestication of the Gothic novel. Jane Austen's class romance "Northanger Abbey" both parodies and sympathizes with the enormously popular Radcliffe trend. More male writers picked up Gothic conventions in the Victorian era, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's "Sherlock Holmes" novels, Robert Louis Stevenson's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," Oscar Wilde's "The Picture of Dorian Gray," H. G. Wells' "The Island of Dr. Moreau" and the quintessential vampire novel, Bram Stoker's "Dracula." Victorian Gothic novels reveal much about Victorian anxieties regarding industrialization, Darwinism and religion. </p>
<p> American Gothic </p>
<p> Gothic literature spread to the United States in the 19th century through American writers such as Edgar Allen Poe, with his famous poems "The Raven" and "Annabel Lee" and short stories "The Tell-Tale Heart" and "The Cask of Amontillado." A literary development within American Gothic is Southern Gothic, of which Poe was a part, and which included texts such as William Faulkner's short story "A Rose for Emily," which narrates the story of a reclusive necrophiliac. The Southern Gothic tradition typically combines horror and the bizarre with race or class struggles in a rural setting. The work of Flannery O'Connor and Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird" also exemplify these conventions. </p>
<p> Modern Horror </p>
<p> Today, many genres derive from the Gothic tradition. Stephen King and Anne Rice are both household names in Gothic fiction who use the unknown to build suspense. Their books incorporate classic horror characters such as vampires, hearkening back to Stoker's "Dracula," and serial killers, playing on the same fascination Victorians had toward the notorious "Jack the Ripper" in 19th-century England. Both vampire and horror novels have spawned their own genres, targeting all ages, including teens, through such books as Stephanie Meyers' "The Twilight Saga," and children, through R. L. Stine's "Goosebumps" series. </p>

<p> Adam Burgess, Ph.D. is a university professor, literary reviewer, and expert in American and classical literature and criticism. </p>
<p> The term Gothic originates with the architecture created by the Germanic Goth tribes that was later expanded to include most medieval architecture. Ornate, intricate, and heavy-handed, this style of architecture proved to be the ideal backdrop for both the physical and the psychological settings in a new literary genre, one that concerned itself with elaborate tales of mystery, suspense, and superstition. While there are several notable precursors, the height of the Gothic period, which was closely aligned with Romanticism, is usually considered to have been the years 1764 to about 1840, however, its influence extends to 20th-century authors such as V.C. Andrews, Iain Banks, and Anne Rice. </p>
<p> Plot and Examples </p>
<p> Gothic plotlines typically involve an unsuspecting person (or persons)—usually an innocent, naive, somewhat helpless heroine—who becomes embroiled in complex and oftentimes evil paranormal scheme. An example of this trope is young Emily St. Aubert in Anne Radcliffe’s classic Gothic 1794 novel, "The Mysteries of Udolpho," which would later inspire a parody in form of Jane Austen’s 1817 "Northanger Abbey." </p>
<p> The benchmark for pure Gothic fiction is perhaps the first example of the genre, Horace Walpole’s "The Castle of Otranto" (1764). Although not a long tale in the telling, the dark, its oppressive setting combined with elements of terror and medievalism set the bar for an entirely new, thrilling form of literature. </p>
<p> Key Elements </p>
<p> Most Gothic literature contains certain key elements that include: </p>
<p> Atmosphere: The atmosphere in a Gothic novel is one characterized by mystery, suspense, and fear, which is usually heightened by elements of the unknown or unexplained. </p>
<p> Setting: The setting of a Gothic novel can often rightly be considered a character in its own right. As Gothic architecture plays an important role, many of the stories are set in a castle or large manor, which is typically abandoned or at least run-down, and far removed from civilization (so no one can hear you should you call for help). Other settings may include caves or wilderness locales, such as a moor or heath. </p>
<p> Clergy: Often, as in "The Monk" and "The Castle of Otranto," the clergy play important secondary roles in Gothic fare. These (mostly) men of the cloth are often portrayed as being weak and sometimes outrageously evil. </p>
<p> The paranormal: Gothic fiction almost always contains elements of the supernatural or paranormal, such as ghosts or vampires. In some works, these supernatural features are later explained in perfectly reasonable terms, however, in other instances, they remain completely beyond the realm of rational explanation. </p>
<p> Melodrama: Also called “high emotion,” melodrama is created through highly sentimental language and instances of overwrought emotion. The panic, terror, and other feelings characters experience is often expressed in a way that's overblown and exaggerated in order to make them seem out of control and at the mercy of the increasingly malevolent influences that surround them. </p>
<p> Omens: Typical of the genre, omens—or portents and visions—often foreshadow events to come. They can take many forms, such as dreams, spiritual visitations, or tarot card readings. </p>
<p> Virgin in distress: With the exception of a few novels, such as Sheridan Le Fanu’s "Carmilla" (1872), most Gothic villains are powerful males who prey on young, virginal women (think Dracula). This dynamic creates tension and appeals deeply to the reader's sense of pathos, particularly as these heroines typically tend to be orphaned, abandoned, or somehow severed from the world, without guardianship. </p>
<p> Modern Critiques </p>
<p> Modern readers and critics have begun to think of Gothic literature as referring to any story that uses an elaborate setting, combined with supernatural or super-evil forces against an innocent protagonist. The contemporary understanding is similar but has widened to include a variety of genres, such as paranormal and horror. </p>

<p> Gothic Novels: Exploring the Dark </p>
<p> What is the definition of a “Gothic novel”? </p>
<p> Gothic literature first came into existence in the late 18th century, as a loose collection of works that tended to take place in old castles, dilapidated houses, mysterious forests, and other creepy, haunted type of places.In general, a gothic novel is one that exemplifies certain gothic elements: </p>
<p> dark, highly architectural settings </p>
<p> themes of fear, horror, the macabre, uncanniness </p>
<p> the presence of supernatural entities or powers </p>
<p> certain pre-defined character tropes, such as the “wanderer” or the “two-faced” person </p>
<p> Critics also note that this newfound gothic literature was known for providing a sort of “pleasurably terrifying” experience.Though gothic literature emerged as a reaction to and within the Romantic period, there isn’t necessarily one “gothic novel” or one unified gothic genre of literature. Authors from various time periods, countries, and genres have incorporated gothic elements in their works to varying degrees. Some of these authors, like Mary Shelley and Flannery O’Connor, have come to be classified as gothic authors. </p>
<p> Origins of the “Gothic” idea </p>
<p> The gothic concept was largely made popular in England by Horace Walpole, the son of the then-prime minister. He purchased a large house and went about decorating it what he called “the Gothick style,” which included arches, towers, and turrets straight out of medieval Europe. His home was a popular attraction for the English people, many of whom drew influence from his gothic aesthetic.Pictured above, Walpole’s Strawberry Hill house is still open today as a museum to the “finest example of Georgian gothic revival architecture.” </p>
<p> Early Gothic novels </p>
<p> Walpole, and his house, played an important role in the development of the gothic idea in the art world as well, as he published the first “gothic” novel, The Castle of Otranto, in 1764. The Castle of Otranto incorporated many elements that would later mark a gothic novel: supernatural curses, mysterious happenings, romance, death, and passionately dark emotion. The novel’s subtitle is even “A Gothic Story.”Other notable early gothic writers include Ann Radcliffe (The Mysteries of Udolpho), William Beckford (Vathek), and Matthew Gregory Lewis (The Monk). Radcliffe’s book was so popular that it inspired Jane Austen’s famous parody, Northanger Abbey.Above all, gothic novels share a setting of darkness, mysteriousness, and decay that is mirrored somehow in the fallen or broken nature of its characters. Fear and terror play an important role, both for the characters in the novels and for the readers themselves. </p>
<p> Later Gothic novels </p>
<p> Several authors continued the gothic tradition in the early 19th century. Lesser known authors include Charles Robert Maturin (Melmoth the Wanderer) and James Hogg (The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner), both of whom published in the 1820s.Three classics that have really come to define the gothic novel were also published throughout the 1800s: Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley’s Frankenstein, Bram Stoker’s Dracula, and Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. </p>
<p> Frankenstein </p>
<p> Published in 1818, Frankenstein tells the story of a Victor Frankenstein, a scientist who discovers a vague element that gives life to inanimate object. Through a horrific experiment, young Frankenstein creates a monster. Though many people use “Frankenstein” as the name of the monster, in reality, the monster is never named. He is referred to as “monster,” “creature,” or even “devil.”The terror that the grotesque monster evokes, along with the novel’s gothic setting, makes Frankenstein one of the strongest examples of gothic literature. John Mullan points out that Frankenstein reiterated the important gothic motif of the double, or “a character’s sense of encountering a double of him- or herself.”Frankenstein is also regarded as one of the earliest works of science fiction. </p>
<p> Dracula </p>
<p> Published much later, in 1897, Dracula is another perfect example of a gothic novel. With its dark Transylvanian castle setting and its inhuman, wicked characters, Dracula embodies several elements of gothic literature. As a continuation of the invasion literature genre that was popular in Victorian England, the novel also played on readers’ fears of powerful foreign invaders taking over.Though Dracula was not the first vampire novel, it did play a large role in popularizing the theme. </p>
<p> The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde </p>
<p> The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a novella that was first published in 1886. Now a classic trope, this novella examines the battle of good versus evil that occurs within each of us. Gothic literature’s double motif is perhaps never more clearly employed than in this work. The gothic novella also tapped into cultural fears of moral decline and evil, both of which were reflected in the increasing power of the hideous Mr. Hyde. </p>
<p> Gothic influences in later literature </p>
<p> Since its beginning in the 1700s, elements of the gothic novel have influenced many individual authors and literary movements. Among the most visible and important influences of the gothic novel are on two very distinct and time-separated genres: Victorian literature and Southern Gothic literature. </p>
<p> Victorian literature </p>
<p> The Victorian genre of literature refers to works written under the British reign of Queen Victoria, spanning a roughly 80-year range in the 1800s.Gothic ideas had an especially strong influence on Victorian literature, even though these literary works are themselves not always classified as gothic. The following Victorian classic novels are especially notable for their gothic novel elements: </p>
<p> Popular during the same time, many of the works of Edgar Allan Poe, the American poet and short story writer, strongly display gothic elements, including ancient/medieval settings, wicked characters, and dark themes of fear, horror, and uncertainty.Read how the plot and characters of Wuthering Heights develop throughout the story in a manner that’s both uniquely intriguing and typical of a Victorian Gothic novel. </p>
<p> Southern Gothic literature </p>
<p> Unlike Victorian literature, which drew inspiration from gothic novels while maintaining its status as its own distinct genre, Southern Gothic literature is really a subgenre of gothic literature. Southern Gothic literature takes many of the same elements—horror, mystery, disfigured or broken characters, supernatural influence, and the macabre—and places them in the unique context of the American South.Prominent Southern Gothic authors include Eudora Welty, William Faulkner, Flannery O’Connor, Carson McCullers, Cormac McCarthy, and Tennessee Williams. </p>

<p> The intention of Gothic architecture was to create soaring structures suggestive of the glory of heaven in the Christian religion. This had to be achieved structurally in stone or wood, the only materials available; the tall structures had to be structurally sound, and they had to be constructable by a method using minimum calculations and simple hand tools. </p>
<p> The result was a system using columns, pointed equilateral arches ('Gothic arches'), vaulted ceilings and in many buildings, buttresses and flying buttresses. </p>
<p> The style is based on the geometry of a circle, with ratios, curves and chords derived from circles. There was constant experimentation to produce ever more extreme examples of what the materials and structural system would allow. The introduction of extensive glazing prompted increasingly fine structural elements and increasingly large windows. </p>
<p> Chartres Cathedral is a good example of extreme Gothic architecture. That it was built in around 1200AD is remarkable, and demonstrates that Gothic architecture, whatever its later associations, is a significant achievement in design and construction. So, look past the gargoyles and craggy, Batman outlines, and appreciate the strange and wonderful phenomenon of Gothic architecture. </p>

<p> Gothic cathedral </p>
<p> Before the Gothic, the generally prevailing style of construction and art was the Romanesque and then the Gothic was followed by the Renaissance . </p>
<p> For the evolution from the Romanesque to the Gothic system, many transition stages can already be found in late Romanesque , especially in Normandy and Burgundy . </p>
<p> While the Gothic style in architecture can be distinguished from other styles, this assignment is not always possible with absolute certainty in the case of sculptures and paintings. </p>
<p> Hieronymus Bosch (1450 - 1516) as one of the most famous painters of the time showed the viewer a bizarre, frightening world in an optical cacophony of the end times mood. A strong influence by the late Gothic can be seen in his works. </p>
<p> The Gothic was fundamentally an epoch in which the strictly Christian models of thought were visualized, making extensive use of symbolism and allegory. </p>
<p> In architecture, a distinction is made between early, high and late Gothic, which were adopted at different speeds in the different European regions. </p>
<p> Originally, the Gothic was also pointed arch style called - this is because of the pointed arch is a central element of Gothic architecture. </p>
<p> Gothic arch shapes. </p>
<p> On the left a normal pointed arch , in the middle a pressed pointed arch and on the right an elevated pointed arch , which is also called the lancet arch . </p>
<p> Here you can see a Gothic tracery window with a pointed arch: </p>
<p> In architecture, a tracery is the filigree work of stonemasons in the form of flat designs of windows, balustrades and open walls. </p>
<p> The tracery consists of geometric patterns that are worked out as stone profiles, whereby the stone is completely broken through (skeletonized). If these decorations are placed as a decorative panel in front of a closed wall surface, this is also called glare tracery . </p>
<p> If they stand free in front of a wall, they are called veil tracery . </p>
<p> Vertical struts running in parallel are also called rod structures . </p>
<p> In high Gothic , the outer buttresses of cathedrals become one of the most important design elements, at the same time they make constructions possible that were previously not thought of. </p>
<p> However, the tracery was one of the defining elements of Gothic architecture in high and late Gothic. </p>
<p> Tracery is also found in other places such as the balustrades of the walkways ( triforium ), galleries , tower helmets or openwork and pre-stressed walls in the facade. </p>
<p> The last Gothic style of late Gothic in France, Flanders and England is called the Flamboyant ; the word comes from the French and means something like "flaming". This style is characterized by the excess length of certain forms of the tracery, which are reminiscent of flames. </p>
<p> Flamboyant, Saint Maclou </p>
<p> Conceptual origin: </p>
<p> The term Gothic derives from the Italian Gotico , which means strange , bizarre or barbaric and was originally meant as a dirty word. </p>
<p> And this curse word aimed at the Germanic tribe of the Goths . </p>
<p> In the Renaissance , the Italian art theorist Giorgio Vasari coined the term; he wanted to express his contempt for medieval art against that of the golden age of antiquity. </p>
<p> In 1550 Vasari called the Gothic as " maniera tedesca " and " maniera de 'Goti " and called them monstrous and barbaric. In doing so, he followed the negative image that the Italians had of the Goths and actually all of northern Europe. </p>
<p> Today, Vasari's pejorative judgment about the Gothic is not remotely shared - the name Gothic was nevertheless adopted. </p>
<p> The Gothic builders wanted to create high-rise buildings flooded with light. In order to achieve this goal, the elements that have been known since Romanesque, such as rib vaults , pointed arches and buttresses, have been consistently developed further, whereby design and form have been combined with static requirements. Every detail should symbolize the whole and form a complete unity with it. </p>
<p> Gothic church buildings were therefore in perfect harmony for beauty, light, geometry, proportions, material and color. </p>
<p> Of course, windows had also existed in the Romanesque style that had prevailed until the Gothic period, but in the Gothic period, light and the bundling of light were formally celebrated and thus became the most important design element of a cathedral. </p>
<p> Window rose </p>
<p> The rays of the sun, which symbolize the light of God, should flow through the entire church building down to the last corner, transforming it into built, jubilant metaphysics. </p>
<p> Such examples of light architecture can be found especially in France at the Cathedral of Saint-Denis (1130), at the Cathedral of Chartres (1194–1260) and at the Sainte-Chapelle (1244–1248) in Paris. </p>
<p> Sainte-Chapelle </p>
<p> In addition to the general temporal differentiation in early, high and late Gothic, a distinction is also made in different style levels or designs: </p>
<p> As Flamboyant (French. For "flaming") is the last stage of the Late Gothic style in France and England is called. </p>
<p> The perpendicular style (English: "vertical style") is a typical late Gothic style level for England. </p>
<p> The Decorated Style (English Decorated Period) is a phase in the English Gothic, which lasted from 1250 to 1370. </p>
<p> The brick Gothic is a common in northern Germany and the Baltic region construction from the 12th to the 16th century (see separate section below). </p>
<p> The German special Gothic is a controversial, ideologized style level designation of the Gothic style of the 14th and 15th centuries in Germany. </p>
<p> The Chiaramon style is a 14th century Gothic style in Sicily. </p>
<p> As Nachgotik the continuing outside the actual age of the Renaissance and even Baroque-Gothic architectural style is called. </p>
<p> The Gothic Revival or Gothic Revival is one of the earliest styles of historicism in the 19th century. The design language was based only on an idealized medieval image of the Gothic period. </p>
<p> So where does the slightly scary, sometimes bizarre effect that Gothic has on some people come from? </p>
<p> It may be due to the fact that the interplay of light and shadow transforms the church interior into a quasi mystical space. </p>
<p> The walls lose their materiality, they appear thin and delicate and are pierced by huge windows. </p>
<p> They no longer protect, are no longer massive and defiant as in Romanesque religious buildings. </p>
<p> The windows have glass surfaces with blue, reddish and gold tones and a bluish-violet, mysterious light fills the whole room. To further reinforce this effect, the walls and pillars are usually colored in red-brown tones. </p>
<p> Sometimes gemstones and copper threads are integrated into the windows to achieve a special, mystical refraction of light. </p>
<p> The columns are bundled and thus lose their thickness and the entire architecture is intended to make the sky perceptible through human senses. </p>
<p> The window areas are sometimes so large that massive stone walls take a back seat and are reduced to the absolutely necessary static minimum. </p>
<p> Buttresses and delicate decorations are reminiscent of skeletons and bone structures. Figures and sculptures often show dragons and monsters, gargoyles in the form of gargouilles (Gurgler or Gargoyle) are a typical style element. </p>
<p> These buildings are reminiscent of transience and death, which can also be felt in the interior of the cathedrals in light-flooded air and which manifests itself in the darker areas with their mysterious, filigree walls with holes and openings and a dark foreboding. </p>
<p> The question contains a subjective assertion, which many people (certainly most architects) won’t agree with. </p>
<p> I find Gothic architecture quite beautiful. It can be both delicate and powerful at the same time. The intricate craftsmanship is stunning. These buildings could take a hundred years to complete, and everywhere you look there is carved decoration. </p>

<p> They became popular on Gothic buildings, where they were carved into the shapes of demons and animals, so many people think that a Gargoyle is specifically an intricately-carved water spout. </p>
<p> If you haven’t grown up with or spent any real time looking at Gothic architecture (here in the UK it’s all over the place) and are only used to bland modern design, I can see how one might find it jarring. </p>
<p> However, just like with any other form of art, there are some types which reward effort put into appreciate them. </p>
<p> I used to hate opera and choral music, but I heard Henry Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas. It’s now one of my absolute favourite pieces of music. </p>
<p> To anyone only used to modern music, they might well find this tedious and old-fashioned, but if you really listen to it carefully and objectively you can open yourself up to its extraordinary beauty. </p>
<p> If you don’t like Gothic architecture, you just don’t get it - yet! </p>

<p> It’s interesting that you describe Gothic architecture as “grotesque.” The word “grotesque” came into use in the 17th century when classicism—i.e. the styles of ancient Greece and Rome—were praised and medieval art, including Gothic architecture was disparaged. The word “Gothic” itself means “art of the Goths,” and the Goths, of course, were the barbarians who helped take down Rome in the 5th century CE. (Remember also the Vandals, another barbarian tribe, and our word “vandalism” describing wanton acts of damage inflicted on public and private property.) </p>

(Remember also the Vandals, another barbarian tribe, and our word “vandalism” describing wanton acts of damage inflicted on public and private property.) </p>
<p> So grotesque generally referred to a kind of decoration that emphasized the use of botanical elements and fantastical creatures that often were distorted or exaggerated for emotional and expressive effect. Yes, there was an expression of the pain and hardship of earthly life expressed in this architecture—but even more were there praise for the glory of God, expressions of hope for salvation, great celebrations of ones town and community. </p>
<p> When you describe Gothic architecture as “grotesque,” are you suggesting that it is ugly and ill-proportioned? Depraved in execution and presentation? I hope not. Gothic architecture is, at its best, elegant, inventive, imaginative and marvelous (i.e. “full of marvels”). In fact, next to the Romanesque style that preceded it (“Romanesque” because of the round or Roman-style arches used in portals, vaulting and fenestration) Gothic is like stone lacework through which light pours because the pointed arch and new flying buttress allow the wall to be much taller and thinner, and for much of the masonry to be replaced with glass. In fact, for Europeans of the 12th to 14th centuries, this style of architecture was new, miraculous and very, very modern. </p>
<p> When looking at and thinking about any of the arts, you may wish to avoid framing your question as a negative assumption. Do not ask “Why is Gothic architecture so grotesque” but ask, instead, a question like why Gothic architecture is so radically different from the great buildings of the Roman empire that preceded it, for instance. </p>
<p> Cathedrals built during the Gothic period were by far the most decorative of all Medieval architecture their inspiration was ghosts and nightmares, the grotesque showed as ugly, devilish gargoyles as rain spouts. They became increasingly decorative since the Romanesque. </p>
<p> Characteristics such as pointed arches, flying buttresses, and elaborate stained glass windows were common during this period.

<p> Characteristics such as pointed arches, flying buttresses, and elaborate stained glass windows were common during this period. Another aspect of Gothic architecture are gargoyles and grotesque figures. Although such creatures can be found prior to the Gothic era, they became much more common. Not only religious imagery adorned Cathedrals, but also secular as well. These characters date back to the beliefs of the earlier pagan groups and the legends related to the towns surrounding the cathedral. </p>
<p> Gothic architecture wanted to bring more sunshine to peoples lives. Before Gothic era, in Romanesque they didn’t have enough knowledge to make it airily, open, tall, and the times and events echoed in architecture. When Gothic started, a lot of money came from the Crusaders, and back home they learned how to better utilize arc (from semicircular to pointed - transfer forces are better so you can build higher), different vault (cross with beams), new type of pillars, flying buttresses, circular windows for more light, etc. </p>

<p> The idea behind Gothic architecture was vertical ‘climb’ to heaven, to fell the space around, to feel God. Something mystical, something holy. The term Gothic meant intracate and ornate architecture. </p>
<p> Only in 18 century Romantic era, with the story Castele of Otranto (1764 by Horace Walpole) it was used as a barbaric term. It was meant as a joke but it stuck to it. In Romantic era they explored nature, and death, and love, and supernatural, mystery, strange events, and its from a narrative point. </p>
<p> Grotesque term is used as ‘very strange or ugly in a way that is not normal or natural’. It’s used for human body (Frankenstein, or Kafka). And while in 18 century they were reviving past eras. With Dark Romanticism you have terror, and gruesome, and dark, picturesque scenary, you have fiction, and a lot of themes came from Middle Ages - settings, events, themes. Well in their setting and events at the time. </p>
<p> So we now have association with Gothic from 18 century. With that change, the symbolism changed for future generations. We do not see the gargoyles as the builders saw it. We see grotesque motives because of re-reading the symbolism from one architectural era and literature. We changed the narrative. </p>
<p> Gothic architecture is quite clean. Even with all the ‘kitsch’ it had a meaning to it all. But in the essence Gothic architecture is about unity - how linking and merging parts form it. Connected pillars on the facade and tall windows, how it looks like its hovering, so tall, so strong yet so light. The decorative elements tells the same story. One wrong block would bring down the whole thing. It was about Earthly perfection and striving to reach the Heaven. </p>
<p> “Grotesque” comes from the italian renaissance, when the architects discovered the house of Nero, which was beyond the ground (in a “grotto”) where the decoration was not classical, as they believed. The grotesque style was used for the first time in the Villa Farnesina by Giulio Romano and Raffael a.o. But only for decoration. </p>
<p> Gothic has nothing to to with grotesque. It was a very rational style. And grotesque decoration I have never seen in a Gothic Church. Maybe you mean the Neogothic like in Victorian Britain. </p>
